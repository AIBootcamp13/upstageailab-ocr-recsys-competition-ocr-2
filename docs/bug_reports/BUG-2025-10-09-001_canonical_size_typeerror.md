# Bug Report: canonical_size TypeError in Validation Pipeline

**Bug ID**: BUG-2025-10-09-001
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Priority**: HIGH
**Severity**: CRITICAL (blocks validation pipeline)
**Reported By**: AI Assistant
**Reported Date**: 2025-10-09
**Resolved Date**: 2025-10-10

## üìã Executive Summary

A `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` was occurring during validation steps when accessing `canonical_size` in the OCR lightning module. The bug was introduced by an interaction between Phase 6B (RAM caching) and Phase 6C (pre-normalization) performance optimizations.

**Root Cause**: Numpy arrays return total element count from `.size` attribute, while PIL Images return `(width, height)` tuple, causing type inconsistency in the dataset pipeline.

---

## üîç Detailed Description

### Problem Statement
During model validation, the following error occurred:
```
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```
Location: `ocr/lightning_modules/ocr_pl.py:132` in validation_step method

### Error Stack Trace
```
File "ocr/lightning_modules/ocr_pl.py", line 132, in validation_step
    "canonical_size": tuple(batch.get("canonical_size", [None])[idx])
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
```

### Affected Components
- **Primary**: `ocr/datasets/base.py` - Dataset item creation
- **Secondary**: `ocr/lightning_modules/ocr_pl.py` - Validation step processing
- **Related**: `ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py` - Batch collation

---

## üêõ Steps to Reproduce

### Prerequisites
- Phase 6B RAM caching enabled (`preload_images: true`)
- Phase 6C pre-normalization attempted (`prenormalize_images: true`)
- Validation dataset with cached images

### Reproduction Steps
1. Configure dataset with `preload_images: true` and `prenormalize_images: true`
2. Run model training/validation cycle
3. Execute validation step that accesses `canonical_size`
4. Observe `TypeError` when attempting `tuple(integer_value)`

### Minimal Reproduction Code
```python
# This demonstrates the type difference
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# PIL Image (works)
pil_img = Image.new('RGB', (224, 224))
print(f"PIL size: {pil_img.size}")  # (224, 224) tuple

# Numpy array (fails)
np_array = np.array(pil_img)
print(f"Numpy size: {np_array.size}")  # 150528 int

# The bug: tuple() called on int
try:
    result = tuple(np_array.size)  # This fails
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

## üéØ Expected vs Actual Behavior

### Expected Behavior
- `canonical_size` should always be a `(width, height)` tuple
- Validation pipeline should process without type errors
- Consistent behavior regardless of image caching strategy

### Actual Behavior
- `canonical_size` was sometimes an integer (total pixel count)
- `tuple(integer)` call in lightning module failed
- Validation pipeline crashed with TypeError

---

## üî¨ Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Root Cause
The bug was caused by inconsistent handling of the `size` attribute across different image object types:

| Object Type | `.size` Returns | Expected Format |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| PIL Image | `(width, height)` tuple | ‚úÖ Correct |
| Numpy Array | Total elements (int) | ‚ùå Incorrect |

### Architectural Root Cause
Phase 6B introduced image caching as numpy arrays, but Phase 6C's pre-normalization feature changed the code path to use these arrays directly without proper type handling.

### Code Flow Analysis
```
1. Phase 6B: Images cached as numpy arrays in RAM
2. Phase 6C: prenormalize_images=True sets is_normalized=True
3. __getitem__: image = image_array (numpy array)
4. org_shape = image.size ‚Üí returns integer
5. Collate: canonical_sizes = [integer, ...]
6. Lightning: tuple(integer) ‚Üí TypeError
```

### Contributing Factors
- **Performance optimizations** introduced type inconsistency
- **Lack of type checking** in dataset pipeline
- **Assumption** that `.size` always returns tuple
- **Insufficient testing** of optimization combinations

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Severity Impact
- **HIGH**: Blocks validation pipeline completely
- **Scope**: Affects all validation runs with cached pre-normalized images
- **User Experience**: Training fails during validation phase

### Business Impact
- **Development Velocity**: Delays performance optimization work
- **Reliability**: Undermines confidence in optimization features
- **Testing**: Requires additional regression testing for future changes

### Performance Impact
- **Before Fix**: Validation pipeline crashes
- **After Fix**: Validation works correctly
- **Optimization Status**: Phase 6B (10.8% speedup) maintained, Phase 6C reverted

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution & Fix

### Solution Implemented
Modified `ocr/datasets/base.py` to ensure `shape` is always a `(width, height)` tuple:

```python
# Before (buggy):
org_shape = image.size

# After (fixed):
if isinstance(image, np.ndarray):
    org_shape = (image.shape[1], image.shape[0])  # (width, height)
else:
    org_shape = image.size  # (width, height) for PIL
```

### Files Modified
- `ocr/datasets/base.py`: Added type-aware shape extraction
- `configs/transforms/base.yaml`: Reverted ConditionalNormalize
- `configs/data/base.yaml`: Removed prenormalize_images parameter

### Testing Performed
- ‚úÖ Unit tests pass (11/11)
- ‚úÖ Configuration validation passes
- ‚úÖ Type consistency verified across image loading paths

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Type Hints**: Add type annotations for image processing functions
2. **Type Guards**: Implement runtime type checking for critical paths
3. **Consistent Interfaces**: Ensure `.size` always returns tuple format

### Testing Enhancements
1. **Integration Tests**: Test optimization combinations
2. **Type Safety Tests**: Verify data types throughout pipeline
3. **Regression Tests**: Cover image loading and caching scenarios

### Development Practices
1. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout of performance optimizations
2. **Code Reviews**: Focus on type consistency in data pipelines
3. **Documentation**: Document type expectations for image objects
