# **Protocol: Bug Fix and Maintenance Response**

This protocol codifies the AI agent's response process for bug fix requests, ensuring consistent documentation, changelog updates, and user communication. It extends the maintenance protocols by providing a structured approach to handling bugs that require code changes, documentation updates, and user notifications.

---

## **1. Scope & Applicability**

This protocol applies to all bug fix requests that involve:
- Code changes to fix functional issues
- UI/UX regressions or failures
- Performance or compatibility problems
- Data processing errors

It does not apply to:
- Pure documentation updates without code changes
- Feature requests or enhancements
- Configuration-only changes

---

## **2. Trigger Conditions**

Activate this protocol when:
1. User reports a functional bug (e.g., "X is not working")
2. Code investigation reveals the root cause
3. A fix has been implemented and tested
4. The fix requires documentation updates

---

## **3. Response Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Bug Investigation & Root Cause Analysis**

1. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Attempt to reproduce the reported bug using available tools
   - If reproduction fails, identify environmental differences
   - Document reproduction steps and environment details

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Examine relevant code paths using grep_search, read_file, and semantic_search
   - Check recent changes in git history that might have introduced the bug
   - Identify the root cause with specific file locations and code snippets

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Determine scope of affected functionality
   - Assess user impact (blocking, annoying, cosmetic)
   - Identify related components that might be affected

### **Phase 2: Fix Implementation**

1. **Develop Fix**
   - Implement the minimal fix addressing the root cause
   - Ensure backward compatibility where possible
   - Add appropriate error handling and validation

2. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test the fix with the original reproduction case
   - Run relevant automated tests if available
   - Verify no regressions in related functionality

3. **Code Review**
   - Ensure code follows project conventions
   - Add appropriate comments and documentation
   - Validate imports and dependencies

### **Phase 3: Documentation & Communication**

1. **Generate Summary Report**
   - Create a dated markdown summary in `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/`
   - Use naming schema: `DD_bug_description.md`
   - Include: problem description, root cause, changes made, impact, testing

2. **Update Changelog**
   - Add appropriate section in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (Fixed, Changed, etc.)
   - Follow existing format with date and concise description
   - Reference the summary report

3. **Bug Report Generation** (for serious bugs)
   - If the bug represents a serious issue (data loss, security, major functionality), create a bug report
   - Place in `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/DD_serious_bug_report.md`
   - Include: severity assessment, reproduction steps, mitigation steps, prevention recommendations

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update any relevant documentation affected by the fix
   - Ensure inline code documentation reflects changes
   - Update troubleshooting guides if applicable

---

## **4. Documentation Standards**

### **Summary Report Format**

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD: Brief Bug Description

## Summary
One-paragraph description of the bug and fix.

## Root Cause Analysis
Detailed explanation of what caused the bug.

## Changes Made
- File: `path/to/file.py`
  - Description of changes
- File: `path/to/other.py`
  - Description of changes

## Impact
- User-facing changes
- Performance implications
- Compatibility notes

## Testing
- How the fix was validated
- Edge cases considered

## Related Issues
- Links to related problems or future work
```

### **Changelog Entry Format**

```markdown
### Fixed - YYYY-MM-DD

#### Brief Title

**Description**

- **Changes:**
  - List of key changes
- **Impact:**
  - User impact description
- **Related Files:**
  - `path/to/file.py`
  - Summary: `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/DD_summary.md`
```

### **Bug Report Format** (for serious bugs)

```markdown
# ðŸš¨ SERIOUS BUG REPORT: YYYY-MM-DD

## Severity: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM]

## Problem
Description of the serious issue.

## Impact
- User impact assessment
- Data/system integrity concerns
- Business impact

## Root Cause
Detailed technical analysis.

## Immediate Mitigation
Steps users should take immediately.

## Long-term Prevention
Recommendations to prevent similar issues.

## Investigation Notes
Technical details for future reference.
```

---

## **5. Quality Assurance Checklist**

- [ ] Bug successfully reproduced before fix
- [ ] Root cause clearly identified and documented
- [ ] Fix addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Summary report created with proper naming
- [ ] Changelog updated appropriately
- [ ] Documentation references are accurate
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Appropriate testing completed

---

## **6. Communication Guidelines**

### **User Updates**
- Provide clear explanation of the fix
- Include any required user actions
- Reference documentation for details
- Acknowledge if the protocol helped or needs improvement

### **Team Coordination**
- Notify relevant team members for serious bugs
- Update issue trackers if applicable
- Share lessons learned for similar future issues

---

## **7. Protocol Improvement Suggestions**

Based on the Streamlit maintenance protocol experience:

1. **Context Building**: Include quick reference sections for common investigation patterns
2. **Tool Integration**: Provide specific tool commands for frequent debugging tasks
3. **Decision Trees**: Add flowcharts for common bug categories
4. **Template Library**: Maintain templates for different types of bug reports
5. **Cross-references**: Link to related protocols (testing, deployment, etc.)

## **8. Quick Reference**

| Task | Location | Format |
|------|----------|--------|
| Summary Report | `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/DD_description.md` | Markdown |
| Changelog Entry | `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Section under [Unreleased] |
| Bug Report | `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/DD_bug_report.md` | Markdown with severity |
