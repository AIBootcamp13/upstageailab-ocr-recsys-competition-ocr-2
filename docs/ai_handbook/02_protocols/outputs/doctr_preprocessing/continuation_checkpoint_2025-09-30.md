    "Streamlit sidebar exposes a docTR preprocessing toggle driven by the new `preprocessing` section in `configs/ui/inference.yaml`.",
    "`InferenceService` now runs `DocumentPreprocessor` when the toggle is enabled, caches results per mode (docTR on/off), and surfaces before/after visuals plus metadata in the UI.",

#### Continuation Prompt
**Goal:** Integrate docTR-enhanced preprocessing across the OCR inference experience.

**Previous Session Summary:**
- **Completed:** Added a docTR preprocessing toggle and visualization pipeline to the Streamlit inference UI, generated reproducible demo assets, updated workflow docs, and validated preprocessing tests.
- **Key Files:**
  - `ui/apps/inference/state.py`
  - `ui/apps/inference/components/sidebar.py`
  - `ui/apps/inference/components/results.py`
  - `ui/apps/inference/services/inference_runner.py`
  - `scripts/generate_doctr_demo.py`
  - `docs/ai_handbook/02_protocols/11_docTR_preprocessing_workflow.md`
  - Demo assets under `docs/ai_handbook/02_protocols/outputs/doctr_preprocessing/`

**Next Step:**
Launch the Streamlit UI with `uv run streamlit run ui/inference_ui.py`, upload `demo_original.png` from the demo assets, and confirm the docTR toggle produces the expected before/after visuals and metadata. Document any UI observations or follow-up tasks.

I am ready to resume when you are.
