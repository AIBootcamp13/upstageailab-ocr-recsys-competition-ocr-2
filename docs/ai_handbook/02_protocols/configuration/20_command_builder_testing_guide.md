# **Protocol: Command Builder Testing Guide**

## **Overview**
This protocol establishes comprehensive testing strategies for the Command Builder module to ensure stability during refactoring and feature additions. It provides structured approaches for unit testing, integration testing, and CI/CD integration to maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

## **Prerequisites**
- Command Builder module refactored into separate components (models, quoting, builder, validator, executor)
- pytest testing framework installed and configured
- Basic understanding of the Command Builder architecture and UI integration points
- Access to test environment with necessary dependencies
- Familiarity with mocking frameworks for external dependencies

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1: Set Up Test Infrastructure**
Establish the testing environment and basic test structure:

**Create Test Files:**
- Set up `tests/test_command_modules.py` for unit tests
- Create `tests/test_command_builder_ui.py` for UI integration tests
- Add `tests/test_regression_validation_fix.py` for regression testing
- Implement `tests/test_command_builder_smoke.py` for smoke tests

**Configure Test Environment:**
- Ensure pytest is properly configured in `pyproject.toml` or `pytest.ini`
- Set up test fixtures for common test data and mock objects
- Configure test coverage reporting if needed

### **Step 2: Implement Unit Tests**
Test individual Command Builder components in isolation:

**Test Models Module:**
- Validate dataclass instantiation and default values
- Test parameter validation and type checking
- Ensure proper handling of optional parameters

**Test Quoting Module:**
- Test override quoting logic with special characters
- Validate edge cases and boundary conditions
- Ensure proper escaping of shell metacharacters

**Test Builder Module:**
- Validate command construction logic for all command types
- Test parameter substitution and override handling
- Ensure proper integration with quoting utilities

**Test Validator Module:**
- Test command validation logic and error messages
- Validate different command structures and edge cases
- Ensure proper error reporting for invalid commands

### **Step 3: Implement Integration Tests**
Test component interactions and UI integration:

**Component Integration Testing:**
- Test interactions between Command Builder components
- Validate data flow between models, builder, and validator
- Ensure proper error propagation across modules

**UI Component Integration:**
- Test UI components that use Command Builder functionality
- Validate form data conversion to command parameters
- Ensure proper error handling in UI context

**End-to-End Workflow Testing:**
- Test complete command generation and validation workflows
- Validate integration with execution components
- Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

### **Step 4: Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**
Set up automated testing and monitoring:

**GitHub Actions Configuration:**
- Create workflow file for automated testing on relevant file changes
- Configure test execution with proper Python environment
- Set up test result reporting and notifications

**Add Health Checks:**
- Implement periodic health checks for Command Builder functionality
- Add monitoring for test coverage and performance metrics
- Configure alerting for test failures or regressions

## **Configuration Structure**

### **Test File Organization**
```
tests/
├── test_command_modules.py      # Unit tests for individual modules
├── test_command_builder_ui.py   # UI integration tests
├── test_regression_*.py         # Regression tests for fixed issues
└── test_command_builder_smoke.py # Basic functionality smoke tests
```

### **Test Configuration**
```python
# pytest.ini or pyproject.toml configuration
[tool:pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
python_classes = ["Test*"]
python_functions = ["test_*"]
addopts = "-v --tb=short --cov=ui.utils.command"
```

### **CI/CD Workflow Structure**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-command-builder.yml
name: Test Command Builder
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'ui/utils/command/**'
      - 'ui/apps/command_builder/**'
      - 'tests/**'
```

## **Validation**
- [ ] Unit tests cover all Command Builder modules (models, quoting, builder, validator, executor)
- [ ] Integration tests validate component interactions and UI integration
- [ ] Regression tests prevent reintroduction of fixed issues
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically on relevant changes
- [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (minimum 80%)
- [ ] All tests pass in isolated environment
- [ ] Smoke tests confirm basic functionality works
- [ ] Health checks monitor ongoing stability

## **Troubleshooting**
- If unit tests fail due to import errors, check that Command Builder modules are properly installed and accessible
- When integration tests fail, verify component interfaces and data contracts between modules
- If CI/CD pipeline fails, check Python environment setup and dependency installation
- For performance issues in tests, consider using fixtures to avoid repeated setup overhead
- When adding new features, ensure corresponding tests are added before merging
- If test coverage is low, identify untested code paths and add appropriate test cases
