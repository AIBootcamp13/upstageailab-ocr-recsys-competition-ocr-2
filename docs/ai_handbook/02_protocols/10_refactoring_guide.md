# **Protocol Redirect: Refactoring Guide**

> **This document has been superseded.**

All actionable refactoring guidance now lives in [05_modular_refactor.md](05_modular_refactor.md). Use that protocol for planning and executing your modular refactors.

This stub remains only to preserve backlinks. If you arrived here from an old reference, update your links to the consolidated protocol.
