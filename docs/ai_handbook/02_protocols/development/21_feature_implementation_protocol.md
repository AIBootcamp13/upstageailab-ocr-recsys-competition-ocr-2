# **Protocol: Feature Implementation**

## **Overview**
This protocol establishes a structured approach for implementing new features with consistent development practices, data validation, comprehensive testing, and proper documentation. It ensures new functionality integrates seamlessly while maintaining project quality and usability standards.

## **Prerequisites**
- Clear feature requirements and acceptance criteria defined
- Understanding of Pydantic v2 for data contract design
- Knowledge of project testing frameworks and documentation standards
- Access to relevant development tools and validation scripts
- Familiarity with project's modular architecture and integration patterns

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1: Analyze Requirements & Design Data Contracts**
Establish feature scope and design robust data validation structures:

**Requirements Gathering:**
- Clarify feature requirements and acceptance criteria
- Identify stakeholders and define success metrics
- Assess impact on existing functionality and components

**Data Contract Design:**
- Design Pydantic v2 models for new data structures
- Define validation rules, constraints, and error handling
- Ensure compatibility with existing data contracts
- Follow standards in `docs/pipeline/data_contracts.md`

**Architecture Planning:**
- Identify affected components and integration points
- Plan dependencies and scalability considerations
- Design modular implementation approach

### **Step 2: Implement Core Functionality**
Develop feature following established patterns and quality standards:

**Data Contract Implementation:**
- Create Pydantic v2 models with field descriptions and examples
- Implement custom validators for complex validation logic
- Add comprehensive type hints and error messages
- Register contracts in validation pipeline

**Core Feature Development:**
- Implement functionality following coding standards
- Use dependency injection and modular design principles
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging
- Add monitoring hooks and observability features

### **Step 3: Integrate & Validate**
Connect feature to existing systems and ensure quality through testing:

**System Integration:**
- Integrate with existing components and APIs
- Validate data flow and contract compliance
- Test compatibility with current architecture

**Comprehensive Testing:**
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Implement integration tests for component interactions
- Validate data contracts with comprehensive test scenarios
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

### **Step 4: Document & Deploy**
Create complete documentation and prepare for production deployment:

**Generate Documentation:**
- Create dated feature summary in `docs/ai_handbook/05_changelog/YYYY-MM/`
- Document data contracts, validation rules, and API changes
- Include usage examples and configuration instructions

**Update Project References:**
- Add entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under "Added" section
- Update API documentation and relevant guides
- Add data contract references to validation documentation

**Code Documentation:**
- Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Update inline documentation with AI_DOCS markers
- Include examples and migration guides

## **Validation**
- [ ] Feature requirements clearly defined and documented
- [ ] Data contracts designed with Pydantic v2 and fully validated
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, contract validation)
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Feature summary created with proper naming convention
- [ ] Changelog updated with complete feature details
- [ ] Documentation references are accurate and current
- [ ] Code follows standards with type hints and error handling

## **Troubleshooting**
- If data contracts fail validation, review Pydantic model definitions and field constraints
- When integration tests fail, check component interfaces and data flow compatibility
- If documentation is incomplete, use the provided format templates as guidance
- For complex features, consider breaking into smaller, independently testable components
- When performance issues arise, profile integration points and optimize data validation
