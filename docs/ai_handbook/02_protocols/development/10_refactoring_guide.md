# **Protocol: Refactoring Guide (Redirect)**

## **Overview**
This protocol document has been superseded and consolidated into the modular refactoring protocol. It serves as a redirect to ensure backward compatibility with existing references.

## **Prerequisites**
- Need to perform code refactoring
- Looking for refactoring guidance and best practices

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1: Acknowledge Supersession**
This document has been replaced by the comprehensive modular refactoring protocol.

### **Step 2: Access Current Guidance**
All refactoring guidance has been consolidated into the modular refactor protocol.

### **Step 3: Update References**
Replace links to this document with references to the current protocol.

### **Step 4: Use Consolidated Protocol**
Follow the modular refactoring protocol for all refactoring activities.

## **Validation**
- References updated to point to current protocol
- Refactoring activities follow consolidated guidance

## **Troubleshooting**
- If old links are encountered, redirect to modular refactor protocol
- For specific refactoring needs, consult the comprehensive protocol
