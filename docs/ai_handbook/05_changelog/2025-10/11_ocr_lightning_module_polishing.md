# 2025-10-11: OCR Lightning Module Polishing

## Summary
Completed the final polishing phase of the OCR Lightning Module refactor by extracting complex non-training logic into dedicated utility classes. This improves separation of concerns, making the LightningModule focus purely on training loops while delegating specialized tasks to appropriate helper classes.

## Data Contracts
No new data contracts were introduced in this refactoring. All existing data structures and validation rules remain unchanged.

## Implementation Details
- **WandbProblemLogger**: Extracted ~80 lines of complex W&B image logging logic from validation_step into a dedicated class that handles conditional logging, image processing, and resource management
- **SubmissionWriter**: Extracted JSON formatting and file saving logic from on_predict_epoch_end into a reusable utility class
- **Model Utils**: Created load_state_dict_with_fallback utility function to handle different checkpoint formats and torch.compile prefixes
- **OCRPLModule Updates**: Simplified the main module by delegating specialized tasks to helper classes while maintaining all existing functionality

## Architecture Decisions
- **Separation of Concerns**: LightningModule now focuses solely on training/validation/prediction loops
- **Single Responsibility**: Each utility class handles one specific concern (logging, submission, state management)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs and behavior preserved
- **Testability**: Complex logic now encapsulated in independently testable classes

## Usage Examples
```python
# WandbProblemLogger usage (handled internally by OCRPLModule)
wandb_logger = WandbProblemLogger(
  config,
  normalize_mean,
  normalize_std,
  val_dataset,
  metric_kwargs,
)
batch_metrics = wandb_logger.log_if_needed(batch, predictions, batch_idx)

# SubmissionWriter usage (handled internally by OCRPLModule)
submission_writer = SubmissionWriter(config)
submission_writer.save(predict_outputs)

# Model utils usage (handled internally by OCRPLModule)
load_state_dict_with_fallback(model, state_dict, strict=True)
```

## Testing
- **Compilation Tests**: All new files compile without syntax errors
- **Import Tests**: All classes can be imported successfully
- **Integration Tests**: OCRPLModule maintains all existing functionality
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and proper error handling implemented
