# Fixed Command Builder Architecture Override Bug

## Summary
Fixed a bug in the Streamlit Command Builder UI where the "Generate Command" button for prediction commands was producing invalid commands that failed with Hydra logging configuration errors.

## Root Cause
The command builder schemas (`command_builder_predict.yaml`, `command_builder_train.yaml`, `command_builder_test.yaml`) had incorrect `hydra_override` configurations for the architecture selection field. They were setting both `model.architecture_name` and `model/architectures`, but `model.architecture_name` is not a valid override path for prediction/test configs, causing config resolution conflicts that manifested as logging handler configuration failures.

## Changes Made
- Updated all three command builder schemas to use only `model/architectures` as the hydra_override for architecture selection
- This ensures the architecture config group is properly selected without conflicting overrides

## Files Modified
- `ui/apps/command_builder/schemas/command_builder_predict.yaml`
- `ui/apps/command_builder/schemas/command_builder_train.yaml`
- `ui/apps/command_builder/schemas/command_builder_test.yaml`

## Testing
- Ran integration tests for command builder - all pass
- Ran ruff check and syntax validation - no issues
- The fix removes the invalid `model.architecture_name` override that was causing the logging error

## Impact
- Prediction commands generated by the UI will now work correctly
- Training and testing command generation also fixed for consistency
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
