# 2025-10-04_Fixed_Visualize_Predictions_Hydra_Config_Path

## Summary
Fixed the Hydra configuration path issue in `ui/visualize_predictions.py` that was causing `MissingConfigException` when running the visualization script. The script now properly loads configurations from the project root's `configs/` directory.

## Changes Made

### Problem
The visualization script was failing with:
```
hydra.errors.MissingConfigException: Primary config directory not found.
Check that the config directory '/home/vscode/workspace/upstageailab-ocr-recsys-competition-ocr-2/ui/configs' exists and readable
```

### Root Cause
The `load_model_and_data` function was trying to initialize Hydra with a relative config path that got resolved relative to the working directory instead of the project root, causing Hydra to look for configs in the wrong location after our configuration refactoring.

### Solution
1. **Fixed Path Resolution**: Updated the config directory path construction to properly resolve the project root directory and then locate the `configs` directory.

2. **Handled Interpolation Values**: Added proper handling of `${hydra:runtime.cwd}` interpolation values in the configuration that were causing resolution issues when the Hydra context wasn't fully established.

3. **Improved Config Loading**: Used `OmegaConf.open_dict` to safely add missing configuration keys and `OmegaConf.to_container` with manual resolution to handle problematic interpolations.

## Files Changed
- `ui/visualize_predictions.py` - Updated `load_model_and_data` function with proper config path resolution

## Validation
- The visualization script now successfully loads the Hydra configuration
- Model and data modules are properly instantiated
- The script proceeds to the prediction phase (with a different error unrelated to Hydra config)

## Impact
- The `ui/visualize_predictions.py` script now works correctly with the refactored configuration structure
- Users can visualize predictions using the script without configuration errors
- Maintains compatibility with the new modular configuration system
