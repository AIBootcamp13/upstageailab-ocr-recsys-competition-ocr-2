# **Changelog: 2025-09-28 - Initial State & Architecture Refactor**

*This document captures the state of the project at the time of the AI Handbook creation and the completion of the modular architecture refactor.*

## **1. Architecture & Codebase**

* **Status:** Modular Architecture with Component Registry is **COMPLETE**.
* **Core Abstractions:** Abstract Base Classes (BaseEncoder, BaseDecoder, etc.) are implemented and integrated.
* **Component Registry:** A centralized registry at ocr_framework.architectures.registry allows for plug-and-play experimentation with different model components.
* **Supported Architectures:**
  * **DBNet:** Fully migrated to the new modular structure.
  * **CRAFT:** Implemented and registered.
  * **DBNet++:** Decoder variant implemented and registered.
* **Configuration:** The project is fully driven by the Hydra configuration system. The OCRModel can be instantiated with different architectures via config overrides.
* **Benchmarking:** A decoder benchmarking script (scripts/decoder_benchmark.py) is available for systematic component evaluation.

## **2. Process Management**

* **Status:** Orphaned process prevention is **COMPLETE**.
* **Signal Handling:** Graceful shutdown handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) are implemented in training scripts.
* **Process Groups:** Training processes are managed in distinct groups to ensure all child processes (e.g., DataLoader workers) are terminated correctly.
* **Monitoring Utility:** A scripts/process_monitor.py tool is available for listing and cleaning up any stray training-related processes.

## **3. Performance & Dependencies**

* **Status:** Initial performance optimizations are **COMPLETE**.
* **GPU Utilization:** DataLoader configurations have been optimized (persistent_workers, prefetch_factor) and mixed-precision training (precision=16-mixed) is enabled by default to improve throughput.
* **Mixed Precision:** All core components (DBHead, DBLoss, DBPostProcessor) have been updated to be compatible with Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP).
* **Dependencies:** The project uses uv for package management. Key dependencies include PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Hydra, and timm.

## **4. Development Automation**

* **Status:** Code quality and CI/CD automation are **COMPLETE**.
* **Pre-commit Hooks:** Ruff is configured for automatic linting and formatting on commit.
* **CI/CD:** A GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) automatically runs formatting, type checking (Mypy), and the test suite (pytest) on pushes and pull requests.
