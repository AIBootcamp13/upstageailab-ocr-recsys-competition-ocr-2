# 2025-09-29_evaluation_viewer_modular_refactor.md

## Summary
Refactored the monolithic `ui/evaluation_viewer.py` into a modular package structure under `ui/evaluation/` for better maintainability and reusability.

## Changes Made

### Structural Changes
- **Created `ui/evaluation/` package** with modular components:
  - `app.py` - Main application entry point
  - `single_run.py` - Single model analysis view
  - `comparison.py` - Model comparison view
  - `gallery.py` - Image gallery with filtering
  - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

- **Updated `ui/evaluation_viewer.py`** to serve as a backward-compatible wrapper that imports from the new package

### Feature Enhancement
- **Fixed low confidence threshold** from `≤0.8` to `<0.5` in both the filtering logic and UI labels
- Updated filter options to display "Low Confidence (<0.5)" instead of "Low Confidence (≤0.8)"

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Extracted reusable functions** from the monolithic file into appropriate modules
- **Improved import organization** with proper relative imports
- **Enhanced modularity** by separating concerns into focused modules

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `ui/README.md` to reflect the new modular architecture
- Added detailed file structure documentation
- Updated feature descriptions to include new modular capabilities

## Benefits
1. **Better Maintainability** - Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Improved Testability** - Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Enhanced Reusability** - Components can be imported and used independently
4. **Cleaner Architecture** - Follows Python package conventions
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing scripts and commands continue to work

## Migration Notes
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- The `python run_ui.py evaluation_viewer` command works unchanged
- Direct imports from `ui.evaluation` package are now available for programmatic use

## Files Modified
- `ui/evaluation_viewer.py` - Converted to wrapper
- `ui/data_utils.py` - Updated low confidence threshold
- `ui/visualization.py` - Added extracted display functions
- `ui/README.md` - Updated documentation
- New files: `ui/evaluation/__init__.py`, `ui/evaluation/app.py`, `ui/evaluation/single_run.py`, `ui/evaluation/comparison.py`, `ui/evaluation/gallery.py`
