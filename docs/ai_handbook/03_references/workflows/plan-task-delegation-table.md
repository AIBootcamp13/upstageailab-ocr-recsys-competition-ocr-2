### **Defining Model Tiers**

First, let's establish what we mean by "Advanced" versus "Less Advanced" models in the context of your plan:

* **Advanced Model (e.g., Grok, future Claude/GPT models):**
    * **Required for:** Complex refactoring, architectural changes, and tasks requiring multi-file context.
    * **Strengths:** Can understand the "why" behind a change, reason about data flow between different classes, and handle tasks that involve both modifying and deleting code to fulfill a strategic goal.

* **Less Advanced / Specialized Model (e.g., Code Llama, your "Qwen Coder"):**
    * **Best for:** Self-contained, generative tasks with clear inputs and expected outputs.
    * **Strengths:** Excellent at boilerplate generation, writing unit tests for a specific function, creating documentation from a template, or performing pattern-based changes within a single file.

### **Task Delegation Plan**

Here is a phase-by-phase breakdown of which model tier is appropriate for each task.

| Phase / Action Item | Recommended Model Tier | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Create Pre-processing Script** | | |
| 1.1: Write `preprocess_maps.py` | **Less Advanced Model** | **Generative Task.** You've provided the entire, complete code block in the plan. This is a "copy-and-paste" task to create the initial file. No complex reasoning is needed. |
| 1.2: Add Validation & Configs | **Advanced Model** | **Refactoring & Integration.** This requires the model to understand the script's logic and intelligently add Hydra config handling and shape assertions in the correct places. |
| Qwen: Generate Unit Tests | **Less Advanced (Specialized)** | **Perfect Use Case.** As you've identified, generating unit tests from a single, complete script is an ideal task for a specialized code-gen model. |
| **Phase 2: Refactor Data Loading Pipeline** | | |
| 2.1: Modify `OCRDataset` | **Advanced Model** | **Core Refactoring.** This is the most complex step. It requires understanding the shift from loading polygons to loading `.npz` maps, changing the `__getitem__` logic, and altering what the class returns. |
| 2.2: Simplify `DBCollateFN` | **Advanced Model** | **Core Refactoring.** This task is directly coupled with 2.1. The model must understand *why* `make_prob_thresh_map` is being removed and what the new, simpler `__call__` method should do based on the changes in `OCRDataset`. |
| 2.3: Delete Obsolete Files | **Less Advanced / Tool-Assisted** | **Mechanical Task.** A simple instruction ("delete file X") can be handled by a less advanced agent or is often faster for a human to do manually. |
| **Phase 3: Update Configs & Docs** | | |
| 3.1: Clean Up Hydra Configs | **Less Advanced Model** | **Pattern-Based Task.** The instructions ("remove the `polygon_cache` section") are clear and repetitive. This is a great task for a less advanced model that can perform "find and remove" operations across multiple files. |
| 3.2: Create Documentation | **Less Advanced Model** | **Generative Task.** You have provided the full markdown content. The task is simply to create the specified file and paste the content. |
| **Phase 4: Validation** | | |
| 4.1 - 4.3: Run Scripts & Benchmark | **Human-Led (AI Assisted)** | **Execution & Analysis.** An AI cannot run commands and interpret performance metrics. However, you can use a model to help *write* a shell script to automate the benchmark runs or a Python script to parse the results. |
| **Phase 5: Parallelize Pre-processing** | **Advanced Model** | **Complex Refactoring.** Implementing `multiprocessing` correctly, especially with considerations for object pickling and worker initialization, requires a deep understanding of Python and is a classic advanced task. |
| **Phase 6: WebDataset / RAM Caching** | **Advanced Model** | **Major Architectural Change.** Like Phase 2, this involves a fundamental rewrite of the `OCRDataset` class and changes the entire data I/O paradigm. |
| **Phase 7: Integrate NVIDIA DALI** | **Highly Advanced / Specialist** | **Expert-Level Task.** This requires knowledge of a specialized, high-performance library (DALI) and is a significant engineering effort. This should only be assigned to the most capable models. |



### **Recommended Workflow for Orchestration**

You should act as the "Project Manager," orchestrating the work between your AI assistants.

1.  **Start with Less Advanced Models for Boilerplate (Phases 1.1, 3.2):** Use a simple model to create the initial `preprocess_maps.py` script and the `preprocessing_guide.md` from the content in your plan. This gets the file structure in place.

2.  **Delegate to the Advanced Model for Core Refactoring (Phases 1.2, 2.1, 2.2):** This is the main event. Provide the advanced model with the context of `preprocess_maps.py`, `ocr_dataset.py`, and `db_collate_fn.py`. Give it the clear instruction to implement the pre-processing pipeline by modifying these files according to the logic in your plan.

3.  **Use Specialized Models for Parallel Tasks (Qwen Unit Tests):** While the advanced model is working on the refactoring, you can run your Qwen Coder on the *original* files to start generating a baseline of unit tests. Once the refactoring is done, you can run it again on the *new* files.

4.  **Final Cleanup with Less Advanced Models (Phase 3.1, 2.3):** After the core logic is in place, use a less advanced model for the cleanup tasks: removing the config sections and deleting the obsolete Python files.

By breaking down your excellent plan this way, you can use the right tool for each job, maximizing efficiency and letting your most powerful models focus on the complex architectural work where they provide the most value.
