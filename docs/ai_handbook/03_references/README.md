# **Reference: 03_references Directory Overview**

This directory contains reference documentation, guides, and technical resources for the OCR project.

## **Overview**

This directory contains reference documentation, guides, and technical resources for the OCR project. It serves as a comprehensive repository of technical information, usage guides, and integration documentation for developers working with the OCR system.

## **Key Concepts**

### **Reference Documentation**
Comprehensive technical information about system architecture, components, and data flow patterns that serve as the single source of truth for understanding how the OCR system is structured.

### **Usage Guides**
Practical step-by-step instructions for common tasks, tools, and workflows that help developers effectively work with the system.

### **Integration Documentation**
Documentation for integrating with external tools, services, and AI agents, including setup instructions, API usage, and best practices.

## **Examples**

### **Architecture Documentation**
- System architecture overview with component diagrams
- Hydra configuration and registry details
- Utility function references
- Evaluation metrics documentation

### **Guides**
- Generating submission files
- Performance monitoring callback usage
- PyTorch Lightning checkpoint callback usage
- Streamlit component compatibility validation

## **Configuration Options**

### **Architecture Docs**
- Keep numbered for logical progression through system concepts
- Include component diagrams and data flow illustrations
- Document interfaces and integration points

### **Guides**
- Focus on practical, actionable instructions with examples
- Include troubleshooting sections
- Provide clear usage examples

### **Integrations**
- Include setup requirements and configuration options
- Document troubleshooting procedures
- Provide API usage examples

## **Best Practices**

- **Architecture docs**: Keep numbered for logical progression through system concepts
- **Guides**: Focus on practical, actionable instructions with examples
- **Integrations**: Include setup requirements, configuration options, and troubleshooting
- **Updates**: Review and update reference docs as the system evolves
- **Cross-references**: Link related documents across subdirectories when applicable

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
- Outdated documentation: Regularly audit for outdated information
- Missing cross-references: Link related documents across subdirectories
- Incomplete guides: Ensure all steps are clearly documented

### **Maintenance**
- Regularly audit for outdated information
- Archive superseded documents rather than deleting them
- Consider creating an index document if the directory grows significantly
