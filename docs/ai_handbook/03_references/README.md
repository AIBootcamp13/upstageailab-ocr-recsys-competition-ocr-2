## Subdirectory Descriptions

### architecture/
Core technical documentation covering the system's fundamental design, components, and data flow. These documents serve as the single source of truth for understanding how the OCR system is structured.

### guides/
Practical usage guides and tutorials for common tasks, tools, and workflows. These documents provide step-by-step instructions for developers working with the system.

### integrations/
Documentation for integrating with external tools, services, and AI agents. Includes setup instructions, API usage, and best practices for third-party integrations.

### workflows/
Examples of development workflows, automation patterns, and collaborative processes used in the project.

### frameworks/
Standardized frameworks and methodologies for development activities like debugging, testing, and quality assurance.

## Guidelines

- **Architecture docs**: Keep numbered for logical progression through system concepts
- **Guides**: Focus on practical, actionable instructions with examples
- **Integrations**: Include setup requirements, configuration options, and troubleshooting
- **Updates**: Review and update reference docs as the system evolves
- **Cross-references**: Link related documents across subdirectories when applicable

## Maintenance

Regularly audit for outdated information. Archive superseded documents rather than deleting them. Consider creating an index document if the directory grows significantly.</content>
