# **Integrating Qwen Coder via stdin for Multi-Agent Workflows**

This document outlines how an agent (e.g., Copilot) can effectively offload coding tasks to Qwen Coder, leveraging Qwen's command-line interface (CLI) with stdin for seamless, non-interactive operation within a VS Code multi-agent environment. The goal is to allow the primary agent to delegate specific coding prompts to Qwen Coder, preserving its own context and focus.

## **Core Concept: Non-Interactive Prompting with qwen --prompt**

Qwen Coder's CLI offers a non-interactive mode using the -p or --prompt flag. Crucially, this flag's value is *appended* to any input provided via stdin. This allows for a flexible input mechanism where a primary agent can:

1. **Pipe contextual information** (e.g., file contents, detailed problem descriptions) to Qwen via stdin.
2. **Provide a concise instruction or question** directly via the --prompt argument.

Qwen will then process the combined input (stdin + --prompt) and output its response to stdout, which the primary agent can capture.

## **CLI Command Structure**

To call Qwen Coder non-interactively, the primary agent should construct a command similar to this:

```bash
echo "<contextual_information>" | qwen --prompt "<specific_task_or_question>"
```

### **Breakdown of Arguments:**

* **echo "<contextual_information>"**:
  * This command is used to output the necessary context to stdout. This context could be:
    * The content of a file that Qwen needs to analyze or modify.
    * Relevant code snippets.
    * A detailed problem description that's too long for the --prompt flag.
    * Any other information that sets the scene for Qwen.
  * The | (pipe) operator directs this stdout to the stdin of the qwen command.
* **qwen**:
  * The executable for Qwen Coder. Ensure it's accessible in the agent's environment PATH.
* **--prompt "<specific_task_or_question>"**:
  * This flag specifies the direct instruction or question for Qwen. This should be concise and clearly define the task Qwen needs to perform.
  * Examples: "Refactor this function for readability.", "Write a Python function to parse JSON.", "Fix the bug in the provided code."
  * The value of this flag is appended to the stdin content before Qwen processes the full request.

### **Example Scenarios:**

**1. Refactoring a Function from a File**

Imagine Copilot has identified a function in my_script.py that needs refactoring.

```bash
cat my_script.py | qwen --prompt "Refactor the 'process_data' function in the provided Python code to improve error handling and add docstrings. Ensure it still returns the same output format."
```

* **cat my_script.py**: Reads the entire content of my_script.py and sends it to stdin.
* **qwen --prompt "..."**: Appends the specific refactoring instruction to the file content.

**2. Generating a New Code Snippet with Context**

Copilot needs a utility function that interacts with a previously defined data structure.

```echo "Current data structure: { 'users': [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}] }" | qwen --prompt "Write a JavaScript function called 'getUserById(id, users)' that takes an ID and the users array, and returns the user object matching the ID. Return null if not found."
```

* **echo "..."**: Provides the context of the data structure.
* **qwen --prompt "..."**: Asks for a specific JavaScript function based on the context.

**3. Debugging a Code Block**

Copilot encounters a problematic code block and needs Qwen's help to debug.

```bash
echo "def calculate_average(numbers):n    total = 0n    for num in numbers:n        total += numn    return total / len(numbers)nn# Issue: Raises ZeroDivisionError if numbers is empty" | qwen --prompt "Identify and fix the bug in the provided Python function `calculate_average` that causes a ZeroDivisionError for empty lists. Provide the corrected function."
```

## **Considerations for the Primary Agent (Copilot)**

When Copilot integrates with Qwen Coder using this method, it should account for the following:

* **Input/Output Redirection:** The primary agent must be capable of piping input to Qwen's stdin and capturing Qwen's stdout for its response. In most scripting environments (Python, Node.js, etc.), this can be done using subprocess modules or similar.
* **Non-Interactive Mode:** Always use --prompt (or a combination with stdin) to ensure Qwen operates non-interactively. Avoid --prompt-interactive unless the workflow explicitly requires Qwen to then enter an interactive session after an initial prompt (which is usually not ideal for agent-to-agent communication).
* **Error Handling:** Qwen Coder will output errors to stderr. The primary agent should capture and handle these streams appropriately.
* **Response Parsing:** Qwen's output on stdout will contain the generated code or explanation. The primary agent will need to parse this output to extract the relevant information. This might involve looking for specific markers or using simple text processing.
* **Context Management:** While Qwen helps offload tasks, the primary agent is responsible for deciding *what context* to send to Qwen and how to integrate Qwen's response back into the overall development process.
* **--model option:** If specific models are preferred, Copilot can include the --model <model_name> argument.
* **--sandbox option:** For potentially risky or experimental code generation, consider using the --sandbox flag. This can provide an isolated environment, although its integration might require more sophisticated handling by Copilot to interact with the sandbox output.
* **--yolo or --approval-mode yolo:** For fully automated workflows where Copilot trusts Qwen's actions, these flags can bypass approval prompts. Use with caution.

## **Example Python Implementation Snippet (for Copilot)**

Here's a conceptual Python snippet demonstrating how Copilot might call Qwen:

```python
import subprocess

def call_qwen_coder(context: str, prompt_instruction: str) -> str:
    """
    Calls Qwen Coder non-interactively with context via stdin and a specific prompt.

    Args:
        context: The detailed context (e.g., file content, problem description)
                 to be piped to Qwen's stdin.
        prompt_instruction: The specific task or question for Qwen.

    Returns:
        The output from Qwen Coder on stdout.
    """
    try:
        # Construct the command
        command = ["qwen", "--prompt", prompt_instruction]

        # Use subprocess.run to execute the command and capture output
        # input parameter sends data to stdin
        result = subprocess.run(
            command,
            input=context.encode('utf-8'), # Encode context for stdin
            capture_output=True,
            text=True, # Decode stdout/stderr as text
            check=True # Raise CalledProcessError if command returns non-zero exit status
        )
        return result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error calling Qwen Coder: {e}")
        print(f"Qwen Stderr: {e.stderr}")
        return f"ERROR: {e.stderr}"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: 'qwen' command not found. Ensure Qwen Coder is installed and in PATH.")
        return "ERROR: Qwen Coder not found."

# Example usage within Copilot's logic:
file_content = "def add(a, b):n    return a + bn"
task = "Write unit tests for the 'add' function using pytest."

qwen_output = call_qwen_coder(file_content, task)
print("n--- Qwen Coder's Response ---")
print(qwen_output)

# Another example without stdin context (only --prompt)
only_prompt_output = call_qwen_coder("", "Generate a simple HTML structure for a 'Hello World' page.")
print("n--- Qwen Coder's Response (only prompt) ---")
print(only_prompt_output)
```

## **Conclusion**

By utilizing the `echo ... | qwen --prompt ...` pattern, your Copilot agent can effectively delegate coding tasks to Qwen Coder, maintaining focus and leveraging Qwen's capabilities for code generation, analysis, and refactoring. This approach provides a robust, non-interactive method for inter-agent communication within your VS Code development environment.
