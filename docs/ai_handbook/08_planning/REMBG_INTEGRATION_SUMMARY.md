## 🎨 How It Fits Into Your Workflow

### Updated Pipeline (5 Stages)

```python
# Your new preprocessing pipeline:

1. Background Removal (rembg)     ← NEW! Clean input
   ↓
2. Document Detection (OpenCV)     ← Easier after bg removal
   ↓
3. Perspective Correction (OpenCV) ← Standard CV
   ↓
4. Adaptive Binarization (OpenCV)  ← Text-friendly
   ↓
5. Gentle Enhancement (PIL)        ← Final polish
```

### Why This Order Works

**Background Removal First** because:
- Removes noise (cluttered backgrounds, shadows)
- Improves detection accuracy (cleaner edges)
- Enhances user experience (cleaner results)

**Then Standard CV** because:
- Detection works better on clean images
- Correction/enhancement benefit from clean input

## 💻 Quick Integration Guide

### Step 1: Test rembg Now (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test on a real image
cd /home/vscode/workspace/upstageailab-ocr-recsys-competition-ocr-2

# Find a test image (receipt, document, etc.)
# Run demo:
uv run python test_rembg_demo.py path/to/your/image.jpg

# Check results in rembg_results/ directory
ls rembg_results/
```

### Step 2: Add to Week 1 Plan (Tomorrow)

When you start Week 1 of Option C:

```python
# Day 1: Background Removal (instead of just detection)

# Create preprocessing_viewer_v2/preprocessing/background_removal.py
# Copy code from option_c_with_rembg_integration.md

# Test it works:
from preprocessing.background_removal import BackgroundRemover
import cv2

remover = BackgroundRemover()
image = cv2.imread("test.jpg")
result = remover.remove_background(image)

cv2.imwrite("output.jpg", result.image_no_bg)
print("✅ Background removed!")
```

### Step 3: Build Streamlit UI (Week 3)

```python
# app.py - Add background removal toggle

enable_bg_removal = st.checkbox("Remove Background (AI)", value=True)

if enable_bg_removal:
    bg_result = bg_remover.remove_background(image)
    current_image = bg_result.image_no_bg
    results["background_removed"] = current_image
```
