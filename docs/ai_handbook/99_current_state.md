## Completed Work

### Phase 4: TurboJPEG Image Loading ✅
- Optimized JPEG decoding with TurboJPEG
- Findings: [logs/.../phase-4-findings.md](../../logs/2025-10-08_02_refactor_performance_features/)

### Phase 5: Map Preloading Investigation ✅
- Investigated pre-loading .npz probability maps to RAM
- Result: Minimal benefit (maps are small, fast to load)
- Decision: Keep disabled by default

### Phase 6B: RAM Image Caching ✅ **KEEP**
- Implemented image preloading to RAM
- Performance: 158.9s → 141.6s (1.12x speedup)
- Files modified:
  - [ocr/datasets/base.py](../../ocr/datasets/base.py) - Added image caching
  - [configs/data/base.yaml](../../configs/data/base.yaml) - Added `preload_images` param
- Status: **Production-ready, currently disabled**
- **Action**: Enable for validation dataset

### Phase 6C: Transform Pipeline Profiling ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Created profiling script: [scripts/profile_transforms.py](../../scripts/profile_transforms.py)
- Identified bottleneck: Normalization = 87.84% of transform time
- Attempted pre-normalization optimization
- Result: No additional speedup (CPU/GPU parallelism)
- **Cleanup**: Reverted ConditionalNormalize usage and prenormalize_images param
- **Kept**: [scripts/profile_transforms.py](../../scripts/profile_transforms.py) - Useful profiling tool

---

## In Progress

- [x] **Cleanup Phase 6C changes** (revert unnecessary code)
- [x] **Enable Phase 6B for validation** (production use)
- [ ] **Decide on next optimization path**:
  - Option A: Phase 6A - WebDataset (2-3x expected)
  - Option B: Phase 7 - NVIDIA DALI (5-10x expected)
  - Option C: Quick wins - DataLoader tuning, mixed precision (1.2-2x expected)

---

## Known Issues

1. **Validation step canonical_size bug** ✅ **RESOLVED**:
   - Type confusion between PIL.Image.size (tuple) and np.ndarray.size (int) in cached image pipeline
   - Fixed: Added type-aware shape extraction in dataset; see [BUG-2025-10-09-001](../../bug_reports/BUG-2025-10-09-001_canonical_size_typeerror.md)

2. **Map preloading minimal benefit**:
   - Preloading .npz maps to RAM provides <1% speedup
   - Maps are small and fast to load from disk
   - Decision: Keep disabled by default

3. **Transform optimization limited by CPU/GPU parallelism**:
   - Optimizing CPU transforms doesn't improve total time
   - GPU inference is the real bottleneck
   - Need system-level optimization (WebDataset/DALI)

---

## Performance Breakdown (From Phase 4 Profiling)

| Component | % of Total Time |
|-----------|----------------|
| Model Inference | 35% |
| Image Loading | 30% |
| Transforms | 25% |
| Other (batching, etc.) | 10% |

**Phase 6B addressed**: ~10% of the 30% image loading time ✅
**Phase 6C attempted**: 87% of the 25% transform time ❌ (no benefit)
**Still unaddressed**: Model inference (35%), remaining I/O, system overhead

## Next Session Priority

### Immediate (Before Next Session)
1. **Phase 6A WebDataset Investigation**:
   - Research WebDataset implementation for data loading
   - Evaluate integration with existing OCRDataset
   - Assess 2-3x speedup potential

2. **Commit clean state**:
   ```bash
   git add ocr/datasets/base.py configs/data/base.yaml scripts/profile_transforms.py
   git add docs/bug_reports/BUG-2025-10-09-001_canonical_size_typeerror.md
   git commit -m "fix: canonical_size type error + cleanup Phase 6C changes"
   ```

### Short-Term (This Week)
4. **Research next optimization path**:
   - Read WebDataset documentation
   - Evaluate DALI feasibility
   - Try quick wins (DataLoader tuning, mixed precision)

5. **Make decision on next approach**:
   - Phase 6A (WebDataset) - comprehensive, 2-3x expected
   - Phase 7 (DALI) - maximum performance, 5-10x expected
   - Quick wins - low-hanging fruit, 1.2-2x expected

### Medium-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
6. **Implement chosen optimization**
7. **Benchmark and document findings**
8. **Iterate if target not reached**

## Session Continuation: Performance Optimization

I'm continuing the data pipeline optimization project. Read the session handover:
@logs/2025-10-08_02_refactor_performance_features/session-handover-2025-10-09.md

**Current State** (from @docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md):

- **Gap: 1.8-4.5x additional speedup needed**

**Completed**:
- ✅ Phase 6B: RAM image caching (10.8% speedup) - KEEP
- ✅ Phase 6C: Transform profiling (limited success) - CLEANUP COMPLETE
- ✅ canonical_size bug: Type confusion fixed - RESOLVED

**Next Steps**:
1. Clean up Phase 6C changes (revert unnecessary code) ✅ DONE
2. Enable Phase 6B for validation (production use) ✅ DONE
3. Choose next optimization path:
   - **Phase 6A (WebDataset)** - comprehensive, 2-3x expected **[STARTING NOW]**
   - Phase 7 (DALI) - 5-10x expected
   - Quick wins - 1.2-2x expected

## MCP Tools Status

### Currently Available
- ✅ **repomix** (file system) - Used extensively, very useful
- ✅ **seroost-search** - Available but not used (Glob was sufficient)
- ✅ **tavily** (web search) - Available, useful for research
- ✅ **upstage** (document parsing) - Available, not yet used

### Recommendations for Enhancement
1. **Git MCP tool** - Structured git operations
2. **PyTest MCP tool** - Better test execution and parsing
3. **Profiling MCP tool** - Structured benchmark comparison

### Seroost Index Status
- ⚠️ **Needs update** after significant code changes
- Currently no automatic trigger for index updates
- Recommend: Add post-commit hook or manual update workflow
