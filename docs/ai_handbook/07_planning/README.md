## Subdirectory Descriptions

### assessments/
Contains evaluations and assessments of tools, agents, and collaboration strategies used in development.

### data/
Planning documents for data generation, synthetic datasets, and data management strategies.

### logs/
Operational logs tracking delegations to AI agents, task assignments, and progress tracking.

### phases/
Phase-specific documentation including continuation prompts, completion summaries, and phase-related deliverables.

### plans/
Comprehensive planning documents organized by focus area:
- **performance/**: Performance optimization and monitoring plans
- **refactor/**: Code refactoring and architecture improvement plans

## Guidelines

- Use numbered prefixes (01_, 02_, etc.) for sequential documents within subdirectories
- Keep planning documents current and update as project evolves
- Archive completed phases to maintain clarity
- Reference related documents across subdirectories when applicable

## Maintenance

Regularly review and consolidate related documents. Move completed items to appropriate archive locations if the directory becomes cluttered.</content>
