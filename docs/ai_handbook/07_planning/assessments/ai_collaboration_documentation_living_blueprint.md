## Foundation and Context

This strategic plan is based on the comprehensive assessment in [`ai-collaboration-documentation-assessment.md`](../assessments/ai-collaboration-documentation-assessment.md), which evaluated the current AI collaboration documentation framework and identified key areas for improvement including:
- Structural integrity gaps (85% completeness score)
- Content quality inconsistencies (8/10 clarity rating)
- High maintenance burden requiring manual updates
- Limited automation for self-updating mechanisms

The assessment's findings directly inform the phased approach outlined below, with specific recommendations mapped to implementation deliverables.

# AI Collaboration Documentation Assessment: Procedural Blueprint

You are an autonomous AI project manager, my Chief of Staff for executing the AI Collaboration Documentation Assessment strategic plan. Your primary responsibility is to execute the "Living Strategic Plan" systematically, handle outcomes, and keep track of our progress. Do not ask for clarification on what to do next; your next task is always explicitly defined.

**Your Core Workflow is a Goal-Execute-Update Loop:**
1.  **Goal:** I will provide a clear `ðŸŽ¯ Goal` for you to achieve.
2.  **Execute:** You will run the `[COMMAND]` provided to work towards that goal.
3.  **Handle Outcome & Update:** Based on the success or failure of the command, you will follow the specified contingency plan. Your response must be in two parts:
    * **Part 1: Execution Report:** Display the results and your analysis of the outcome (e.g., "All quality checks passed" or "CI/CD integration failed due to authentication issues...").
    * **Part 2: Updated Living Strategic Plan:** Provide the COMPLETE, UPDATED content of the "Living Strategic Plan", updating the `Progress Tracker` with the new status and the correct `NEXT TASK` based on the outcome.

## 2. Procedural Blueprint for Documentation Enhancement

This procedural blueprint elevates the strategic plan to Level 3 detail, providing "pre-compiled thinking" for AI execution. It adapts the code refactoring blueprint protocol to documentation development, ensuring unambiguous, step-by-step workflows for complex deliverables.

### Step 1: Define the "Actors" and Their "Contracts"
**Action:** Define all key components, deliverables, and their interfaces. This establishes clear boundaries and dependencies.

**Actors Identified:**
- **Documentation Framework**: Hierarchical structure in `docs/ai_handbook/` with protocols, references, and assessments
- **Content Creators**: AI agents and human contributors following standardized templates
- **Quality Assurance System**: CI/CD pipeline with validation scripts and metrics dashboard
- **Automation Engine**: Scripts for cross-referencing, freshness monitoring, and content generation

**Contracts:**
- **Input Contract**: Assessment findings and existing documentation structure
- **Output Contract**: Self-sustaining documentation ecosystem with 95% coverage and <2 hours/week maintenance
- **Quality Contract**: All deliverables meet gold standards (95%+ completeness, <7 days update frequency)

### Step 2: Define the "Content API Surface"
**Action:** For each major deliverable, explicitly outline the structure, interfaces, and validation rules.

#### Protocol Template Structure
- **File Format**: Markdown with standardized sections
- **Required Sections**: Overview, Prerequisites, Procedure, Validation, Troubleshooting, Related Documents
- **Validation Rules**: Must include cross-references, code examples, and error handling
- **AI Optimization**: Context bundles, cue markers, bidirectional linking

#### CI/CD Integration Interface
- **Input**: Documentation files in `docs/ai_handbook/`
- **Process**: Link validation, freshness checks, example testing
- **Output**: Health report with scores and alerts
- **Integration Points**: GitHub Actions workflows, automated PR checks

#### Content Standardization Framework
- **Input**: Existing protocol documents
- **Process**: Consistency audit, terminology alignment, style guide application
- **Output**: Updated documents meeting quality benchmarks
- **Validation**: Automated checks for formatting, links, and completeness

### Step 3: Map the Core Logic with Pseudocode
**Action:** For the most complex deliverables, write out the entire workflow in procedural pseudocode. This provides the "assembly manual" for AI execution.

#### Template Creation Procedural Blueprint
```
# 1. **Analyze Existing Patterns:**
#    - Scan `docs/ai_handbook/02_protocols/` for common structures using `find` and `grep`.
#    - Identify 5 core template types: development, configuration, governance, components, references.
#    - Extract shared elements: headings, code blocks, validation steps, cross-reference patterns.

# 2. **Design Template Framework:**
#    - Create base template in `docs/ai_handbook/_templates/base.md` with placeholders.
#    - Add AI-optimized elements: context bundles, cue markers, bidirectional references.
#    - Define validation rules: required sections, link formats, example completeness checks.

# 3. **Implement Template Instances:**
#    - Generate 5 specific templates by extending base framework.
#    - For each template, include realistic examples and error scenarios.
#    - Add template-specific validation logic (e.g., code examples must be executable).

# 4. **Create Validation System:**
#    - Build `scripts/validate_templates.py` to check new documents against templates.
#    - Implement automated feedback: missing sections, formatting issues, link validation.
#    - Integrate with CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/docs-validation.yml`.

# 5. **Deploy and Train:**
#    - Store templates in `docs/ai_handbook/_templates/`.
#    - Update `docs/ai_handbook/README.md` with template usage instructions.
#    - Create training guide for team adoption and AI agent onboarding.
```

#### CI/CD Integration Procedural Blueprint
```
# 1. **Assess Current Infrastructure:**
#    - Check existing workflows in `.github/workflows/` for extension points.
#    - Identify integration opportunities: PR validation, scheduled checks, manual triggers.

# 2. **Design Validation Pipeline:**
#    - Create `docs-validation.yml` workflow with jobs for link checking, freshness monitoring.
#    - Define validation scripts: `scripts/validate_links.py`, `scripts/check_freshness.py`.
#    - Set up metrics collection: coverage scores, update frequencies, error rates.

# 3. **Implement Validation Scripts:**
#    - Build link validator using regex and file parsing.
#    - Create freshness checker comparing file modification dates to expected intervals.
#    - Develop metrics aggregator for dashboard integration.

# 4. **Integrate with CI/CD:**
#    - Add workflow triggers: push to main, PR creation, scheduled daily runs.
#    - Configure failure notifications and automated issue creation.
#    - Set up branch protection rules requiring validation passes.

# 5. **Deploy and Monitor:**
#    - Test workflow on feature branch before merging.
#    - Establish monitoring dashboard for validation results.
#    - Create runbook for maintenance and troubleshooting.
```

#### Content Standardization Procedural Blueprint
```
# 1. **Audit Existing Content:**
#    - Scan all markdown files in `docs/ai_handbook/` for structure consistency.
#    - Identify inconsistencies: missing sections, varying terminology, outdated examples.

# 2. **Develop Standardization Rules:**
#    - Create `docs/ai_handbook/STYLE_GUIDE.md` with formatting standards.
#    - Define terminology dictionary for consistent language.
#    - Establish cross-reference patterns and link formats.

# 3. **Apply Standardization:**
#    - Update 80% of protocols using automated scripts where possible.
#    - Manually review and enhance complex documents.
#    - Validate each update against quality benchmarks.

# 4. **Implement Governance:**
#    - Create `docs/ai_handbook/CONTRIBUTING.md` with standards.
#    - Set up review checklists for new content.
#    - Integrate automated checks into contribution workflow.

# 5. **Monitor and Maintain:**
#    - Establish quarterly content audits.
#    - Track compliance metrics and improvement trends.
#    - Update standards based on feedback and evolving needs.
```

### Step 4: Upgrade AI Prompts
