# Session Complete — Summary & Handover

## Work completed
- **Phase 6B — RAM Image Caching** ✅
    - Result: 10.8% speedup (158.9s → 141.6s)
    - Status: Production-ready; recommend enabling for validation
    - Files: `ocr/datasets/base.py`, `configs/data/base.yaml`

- **Phase 6C — Transform Profiling** ⚠️
    - Result: Normalization identified as 87.84% bottleneck; attempted optimization did not help
    - Status: Revert optimization changes; keep profiling script for future use
    - Files: `scripts/profile_transforms.py` (keep), other changes (revert)

## Survey responses
1. **MCP Tools Usefulness**
     - Very useful; repomix filesystem tools were critical for reading code. Web tools are nice-to-have. All tools functional.

2. **Seroost Semantic Search**
     - Aware of purpose (semantic code search).
     - Not used this session — globbing was sufficient for known paths. Best used for unknown codebases or locating implementations.
     - Index status: likely needs update (no automated trigger available).

3. **Recommended additional tools**
     - High priority: Git MCP (structured git ops), PyTest MCP (test execution), Profiling MCP (benchmark comparison)
     - Medium priority: Docker, Database Query, File Watching

4. **Docs & Context optimization**
     - Most used docs: `docs/ai_handbook/07_planning/`, `logs/.../findings.md`, handover docs
     - Recommendations: add `docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md` (done), add `00_quickstart/overview.md`, use finding templates, add pre/post-session checklists, implement a context collection script, and enable Seroost auto-update via post-commit hook.
     - See `session-handover-2025-10-09.md` (section "MCP Tools & Workflow Questions") for full details.

## Documentation created
- `phase-6b-ram-caching-findings.md` — Phase 6B detailed results
- `phase-6c-transform-optimization-findings.md` — Phase 6C analysis
- `session-handover-2025-10-09.md` — Complete session handover
- `docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md` — Living project status

## Next session actions (before starting)
1. Revert Phase 6C changes:
```bash
git checkout configs/transforms/base.yaml
```

2. Enable Phase 6B for validation — edit `configs/data/base.yaml`:
```yaml
val_dataset:
    preload_images: true
```

3. Commit clean state:
```bash
git add ocr/datasets/base.py configs/data/base.yaml scripts/profile_transforms.py
git add logs/2025-10-08_02_refactor_performance_features/
git add docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md
git commit -m "feature: Phase 6B RAM image caching (10.8% speedup)

- Implemented image preloading to RAM for validation dataset
- Created transform profiling script (Phase 6C)
- Phase 6C transform optimization had limited success
- Benchmark: 158.9s → 141.6s (1.12x speedup)
- Created living status doc: docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md

See findings in logs/2025-10-08_02_refactor_performance_features/
"
```

## Continuation prompt (for next session)
I'm continuing performance optimization. Read:
- `@logs/2025-10-08_02_refactor_performance_features/session-handover-2025-10-09.md`
- `@docs/ai_handbook/99_current_state.md`

Current: **141.6s (1.12x)**
Target: **31.6–79.5s (2–5x)** — Gap: **1.8–4.5x needed**

Next choices:
- Phase 6A (WebDataset) — expected 2–3x
- Phase 7 (DALI) — expected 5–10x
- Quick wins — expected 1.2–2x

Please recommend the best path to achieve a 2–5x speedup target.

Session complete. Documentation and handover are ready. MCP tools (repomix especially) were essential; detailed workflow recommendations provided.
