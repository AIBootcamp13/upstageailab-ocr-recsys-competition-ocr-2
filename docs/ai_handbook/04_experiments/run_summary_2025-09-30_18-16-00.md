**Agent Run Log Summary:**

The agent undertook a series of tasks focused on enhancing the detection pipeline and improving docTR settings.

1. **Detection Improvement**: The agent initiated work on refining the detection fallback and the geometry reliability of docTR, successfully implementing layered document detection with an adaptive threshold and bounding-box fallback in the `preprocessing.py` file.

2. **Configuration Exposure**: The agent then shifted focus to exposing configurable docTR settings, successfully integrating these settings across various configuration files and the Streamlit UI.

3. **Scaling and Logging Adjustments**: The work continued with enhancements to image scaling and logging adjustments, which included adding optional resize controls and ensuring validation images were cropped to prevent magnified logging. These changes were applied to multiple files, including `preprocessing.py` and UI components.

4. **Documentation Updates**: The agent documented the new detection controls and debug workflow in the AI handbook, capturing a checklist for troubleshooting related to docTR preprocessing.

5. **Validation and Testing**: Lastly, the agent ran targeted unit tests to validate the preprocessing changes successfully.

Throughout the process, the actions alternated between starting tasks, coding edits, documentation updates, and running tests, primarily resulting in successful outcomes. The run log reflects systematic progress in enhancing both the functionality and documentation of the detection pipeline.
