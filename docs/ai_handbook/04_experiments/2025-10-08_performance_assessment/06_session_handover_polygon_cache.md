# Session Handover: Polygon Cache Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**From:** Performance Assessment Session
**To:** Polygon Cache Debugging Session

## Context Summary

The performance assessment session successfully determined that polygon caching and performance profiling features are safe to enable but currently provide no performance benefit (actually add 10.6% and 18.8% overhead respectively). However, polygon caching is expected to provide major speed improvements for validation pipelines. The cache implementation exists and is functional, but shows 100% cache misses and 0% hits, indicating the cache is not being utilized effectively.

## Current Status

### âœ… **Completed Work**
- **Performance Assessment:** All optimization features tested and characterized
- **Configuration Issues:** DataLoader params and coordinate mismatches resolved
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Complete framework for feature validation
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive session summary and debug results

### ðŸ”„ **Next Priority: Polygon Cache Debugging**

**Problem Statement:**
Polygon caching should provide 5-8x validation speedup but currently shows:
- 100% cache miss rate
- 0% cache hit rate
- 10.6% performance overhead instead of speedup

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cache should store computed polygon transformations
- Subsequent identical requests should hit cache
- Major performance improvement for repeated validation runs

**Current Behavior:**
- Cache appears populated but never accessed
- Every polygon computation done fresh
- No performance benefit observed

## Technical Details

### Cache Implementation Status
- **Code Location:** `ocr/data/collate_fn.py` (DBCollateFN with polygon caching)
- **Configuration:** `configs/data/base.yaml` (currently disabled)
- **Functionality:** Cache exists and can be enabled without breaking training

### Performance Assessment Results
```
Feature: Polygon Cache
Status: âœ… Functional
Training Time: 70.89s (+10.6% overhead)
Cache Hits: 0% (100% misses)
Recommendation: Debug cache utilization
```

### Cache Configuration
```yaml
# configs/data/base.yaml
data:
  polygon_cache:
    enabled: false  # Currently disabled due to overhead
    # Cache settings when enabled:
    # - Stores computed polygon transformations
    # - Keyed by image path and polygon data
    # - Intended for validation speedup
```

## Investigation Requirements

### Primary Debug Target
**Root Cause:** Why does polygon cache show 100% miss rate?

**Investigation Areas:**
1. **Cache Key Generation:** Are cache keys being generated correctly?
2. **Cache Storage:** Is cache being written to properly?
3. **Cache Retrieval:** Is cache being read correctly?
4. **Key Matching:** Do cache keys match between storage and retrieval?

### Debug Methodology
1. **Enable Cache Logging:** Add detailed logging to cache operations
2. **Inspect Cache Contents:** Examine what keys are stored vs requested
3. **Single-Step Debugging:** Trace cache operations for one sample
4. **Key Generation Analysis:** Verify cache key consistency

### Expected Debug Process
```python
# In DBCollateFN.__init__
self.polygon_cache = PolygonCache(config.polygon_cache)

# During processing
cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(image_path, polygons)
if cache_key in self.polygon_cache:
    # CACHE HIT - should happen but doesn't
    cached_result = self.polygon_cache[cache_key]
else:
    # CACHE MISS - always happens
    result = self._compute_polygons(image_path, polygons)
    self.polygon_cache[cache_key] = result
```

## Debug Artifacts & Tools

### Available Tools
- **Performance Test Config:** `configs/performance_test.yaml`
- **Cache Enable Command:**
  ```bash
  uv run python runners/train.py --config-name=performance_test data.polygon_cache.enabled=true
  ```
- **Debug Scripts:** Performance testing framework in `scripts/`

### Required Debug Output
- Cache operation logs (hits, misses, keys)
- Cache contents inspection
- Key generation verification
- Performance comparison (cached vs uncached)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Cache hit rate > 50% for repeated validation runs
- Measurable performance improvement (>5% speedup)
- No correctness regressions

### Investigation Success
- Root cause of 100% miss rate identified
- Cache key generation logic verified
- Storage/retrieval mechanism validated

## Handover Notes

### Current Environment
- Training pipeline stable and functional
- All configuration issues from previous session resolved
- Performance testing infrastructure ready for cache debugging

### Key Insights from Previous Session
- Performance features are safe but overhead-heavy for small datasets
- Configuration issues often involve conditional parameters
- Always measure actual impact, not theoretical benefits

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Simple:** Enable cache with detailed logging
2. **Inspect Keys:** Compare stored vs requested cache keys
3. **Single Case:** Debug one specific cache operation end-to-end
4. **Verify Logic:** Ensure cache key generation is deterministic
