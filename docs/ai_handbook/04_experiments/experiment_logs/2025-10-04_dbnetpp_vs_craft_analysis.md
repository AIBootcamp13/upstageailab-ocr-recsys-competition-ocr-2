| Metric | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Best val/hmean | 0.9027 (step 2869) |

| Final val/recall | 0.8457 |
| Final val/precision | 0.9668 |
| Performance Drop at Step 2049 | Recall: 0.847 → 0.738 (-0.109), Hmean: 0.894 → 0.831 (-0.063), Precision: 0.956 → 0.972 (+0.016) |
| Training Time | ~XXm (multi-run) |

* **Analysis Tools:** `scripts/analyze_experiment.py` - Automated script to process Wandb CSV exports, detect performance anomalies, and generate filtered summaries for AI analysis.

## **4. Analysis & Learnings**

* DBNet++ achieved slightly higher performance than CRAFT, with best hmean of 0.903 vs CRAFT's results (need to compare from multi-run).
* **Sudden Performance Drop:** At step 2049, val/recall dropped sharply from ~0.85 to 0.74, causing hmean to drop from 0.89 to 0.83. Precision actually improved slightly. This suggests data quality issues in the validation batch at that step.
* **Suspected Cause:** Receipt images dataset (~4000 images) likely contains ~200 rotated or corrupted images. The drop frequency (~2 times per 3000 steps) indicates periodic exposure to problematic batches.
* **Tracing the Drop:** To identify specific batches, implement per-batch logging of metrics and image paths. Log validation metrics per batch and flag batches with recall < 0.8.
* **AI Analysis Requirements:** Provide key metrics (precision, recall, hmean per step), anomaly detection (drops >0.1 in recall), model config, and data insights. Avoid logging raw images or excessive per-sample data.
* **Automation Options:** Use Python scripts to process Wandb CSV exports, detect anomalies using threshold-based rules, and generate filtered summaries. Libraries like pandas for data processing and matplotlib for visualization.

## **5. Next Steps**

* [ ] **Implement Batch-Level Logging:** Add code to log per-validation-batch metrics and image paths to identify problematic batches.
* [ ] **Data Quality Audit:** Create script to scan dataset for rotated/corrupted images using OpenCV checks (aspect ratio, text orientation).
* [ ] **Anomaly Detection Script:** Develop Python script to automatically detect performance drops from Wandb data and generate reports.
* [ ] **Compare CRAFT Results:** Analyze the CRAFT run from the multi-run to confirm DBNet++ superiority.
* [ ] **Fix Data Issues:** Remove or correct identified bad images and retrain to validate improvement.

### **Analysis of DBNet Run 'wchoi189_dbnet-resnet18-unet-db-head-db-loss-bs8-lr1e-3_hmean0.820'**

#### **Performance Analysis**
- **Run Overview:** This DBNet experiment (using EfficientNet-B0 backbone, UNet decoder, DB head, and DB loss) achieved a final hmean of 0.820, lower than the DBNet++ run (0.898), consistent with DBNet's baseline performance as per the [architecture comparison matrix](docs/ai_handbook/06_concepts/01_model_architecture_selection.md).
- **Per-Batch Logging Results:** The run implemented per-batch logging, capturing metrics for 51 validation batches (408 images total). Batch hmean ranged from 0.735 (batch_6) to 0.868 (batch_50), with an overall validation hmean of 0.819.
- **Problematic Batches Identified:** 17 batches showed hmean < 0.80, with the lowest being batch_6 (0.735), batch_44 (0.762), and batch_46 (0.766). These batches contained images with significantly degraded detection performance.

#### **Root Cause Determination**
- **Hypothesis Confirmation:** The per-batch analysis confirms data quality issues as the primary root cause. Specific batches with low hmean contain images that are difficult for the model to process, leading to poor recall and precision.
- **Evidence from Problematic Batches:**
  - **Batch_6 (hmean: 0.735):** Images 000596-000627 showed severe performance degradation, with recall dropping to ~0.61 and precision to ~0.95.
  - **Batch_44 (hmean: 0.762):** Images 003649-003750 exhibited similar issues, indicating potential text orientation or quality problems.
  - **Batch_46 (hmean: 0.766):** Images 003835-003927 also showed low performance, suggesting a pattern of problematic image clusters.
- **Image Analysis:** Sample images from problematic batches (e.g., 000596.jpg) show normal dimensions (960x1280, portrait) but likely contain challenging text detection scenarios such as curved text, low contrast, or complex layouts typical of receipt images.
- **Consistency with Previous Findings:** The batch-level anomalies align with the step-level drops observed in the DBNet++ run, confirming that data quality issues affect multiple architectures similarly.

#### **Conclusions and Recommendations**
- **Primary Root Cause:** Data quality issues in specific validation batches, characterized by images with poor text detectability rather than simple rotation (all sampled images had correct orientation).
- **Next Steps for This Run:**
  - **Data Audit:** Manually inspect images from problematic batches (6, 44, 46, 14, 38, 49, 23, 5, 9, 45) to identify common failure patterns (e.g., curved text, overlapping elements, low resolution).
  - **Model Retraining:** Remove or augment problematic images and retrain to validate performance improvement.
  - **Logging Enhancement:** Extend per-batch logging to include image-level metrics and failure analysis for future runs.
- **Broader Implications:** This analysis validates the need for the proposed data quality pipeline. The identification of specific problematic batches provides concrete evidence for targeted data curation strategies in the [Experiment Analysis Framework Handbook](docs/ai_handbook/02_protocols/21_experiment_analysis_framework_handbook.md).</content>
