# Problematic Images for docTR Cropping Testing

Place images that demonstrate poor green overlay performance here.

## Instructions
1. Copy images that show unacceptable document detection results
2. Name them descriptively (e.g., `small_receipt_poor_detection.jpg`)
3. Add notes about what's wrong with the detection in the filename or a separate notes file

## Expected Image Types
- Small receipts with poor boundary detection
- Documents with complex backgrounds
- Images with irregular document shapes
- Cases where the green overlay is completely wrong
- Edge cases that fail consistently

## Current Status
- No images collected yet
- Waiting for user to provide problematic examples
