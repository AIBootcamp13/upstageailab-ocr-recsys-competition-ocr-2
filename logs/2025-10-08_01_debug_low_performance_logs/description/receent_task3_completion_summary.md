**Three sequentially performed and independent job summaries for task 3.1 - 3.3**


// 3.1
### ‚úÖ **Implementation Complete**

1. **`ThroughputMonitorCallback`** created in `ocr/callbacks/throughput_monitor.py` with:
   - Samples/second throughput tracking per epoch
   - Memory usage monitoring (dataset, cache, peak memory)
   - Batch timing measurements (load time, with transform time placeholder)
   - Bottleneck detection with percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99)

2. **Configuration** added:
   - `configs/callbacks/throughput_monitor.yaml` for easy integration
   - Callback added to default callback configuration
   - Proper export in `ocr/callbacks/__init__.py`

3. **Unit tests** created in `tests/test_throughput_monitor.py`:
   - Throughput calculation testing
   - Memory tracking verification
   - Timing percentile calculations
   - Edge case handling

4. **Quality assurance**:
   - Passed linting (ruff check) with proper formatting
   - Type checking (mypy) with proper annotations
   - All unit tests passing

### üîç **Key Features**

- **Accurate timing**: Uses `time.perf_counter()` for precise measurements
- **Memory tracking**: Monitors process memory, dataset memory, and cache memory
- **Statistical analysis**: Calculates percentiles for performance distribution
- **Console & MLflow logging**: Outputs formatted metrics to both console and MLflow
- **Configurable**: Enable/disable via config with adjustable logging intervals
- **Low overhead**: Minimal performance impact on training

### üìä **Metrics Tracked**

- `samples_per_second`
- `batch_load_time_ms` (avg, p50, p95, p99)
- `memory_dataset_mb`
- `memory_cache_mb`
- `memory_peak_mb`
- `batches_per_second`
- `throughput_efficiency`

The implementation is robust, well-tested, and ready for integration into the OCR training pipeline. It provides comprehensive insights into dataloader performance, helping identify bottlenecks and optimize training efficiency.

## Summary of Implementation

I have completed all the required tasks for the PyTorch Profiler integration:

### 1. Created `ProfilerCallback` class (ocr/callbacks/profiler.py)
- Implemented a comprehensive PyTorch Profiler callback that captures detailed traces of training operations
- Added support for CPU/GPU/Memory profiling with Chrome trace export
- Implemented automated bottleneck detection for top-k slowest operations
- Configurable profiling windows (select specific epochs/steps to profile)

### 2. Created configuration file (configs/callbacks/profiler.yaml)
- Added default configuration with reasonable settings
- Configurable parameters like profile_epochs, profile_steps, activities, etc.
- Disabled by default to avoid performance overhead in regular training

### 3. Updated imports (ocr/callbacks/__init__.py)
- Added ProfilerCallback to the module exports

### 4. Updated .gitignore
- Added `profiler_traces/` directory to be ignored by git

### 5. Created comprehensive unit tests (tests/test_profiler_callback.py)
- Tests for initialization, epoch selection, trace export, and bottleneck detection
- All tests are passing

### 6. Implemented core functionality
- Chrome trace export compatible with `chrome://tracing`
- Bottleneck detection for CPU, CUDA, and memory operations
- Proper handling of profiler lifecycle in PyTorch Lightning hooks
- Logging of top operations with timing information

### 7. Code quality
- Applied linting fixes with Ruff to meet project standards
- Fixed type annotations for MyPy compatibility
- All tests passing

### 8. Integration verified
- Successfully tested trace file generation
- Confirmed Chrome-compatible trace format
- Verified that the callback works as expected with manual testing

The ProfilerCallback is now ready for use in the OCR training pipeline and provides the following key features:

- **CPU/GPU/Memory Profiling**: Captures detailed traces of all training operations
- **Chrome Trace Export**: Generates JSON files compatible with Chrome's tracing tool
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Automatically identifies top-k slowest operations
- **Configurable Windows**: Profile specific epochs and steps to control overhead
- **Performance Monitoring**: Logs detailed metrics and recommendations to console

The implementation follows all the requirements specified in the task, including proper error handling, logging, and integration with the PyTorch Lightning framework.
