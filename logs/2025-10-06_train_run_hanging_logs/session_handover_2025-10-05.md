# Session Handover — 2025-10-05

## Snapshot
- Orientation-aware metric fixes landed; `tests/test_lightning_module.py::test_on_validation_epoch_end_produces_scores_with_orientation` passes locally.
- Large config/documentation restructuring plus new UI tooling and scripts are staged but not committed.
- A sizeable batch of LOW_PERFORMANCE_IMGS JPEGs was added to the repo; consider whether they belong under version control.

## Latest Commands
- `pytest tests/test_lightning_module.py` → pass
- `uv run python runners/train.py ...` → fails during validation sanity check (see below)

## Current Blocker
- Training aborts with `RuntimeError: DataLoader worker ... killed by signal: Terminated` while running the validation sanity check. Root cause likely inside the dataloader/collate path or an out-of-memory kill, but the exact stack trace is truncated.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Re-run the failing training job with full Hydra error output to capture the real exception:
   ```bash
   HYDRA_FULL_ERROR=1 uv run python runners/train.py exp_name=configs_refactored-dbnet-unet-mobilenetv3_small_050 logger.wandb.enabled=true model.architecture_name=dbnet model/architectures=dbnet model.encoder.model_name=mobilenetv3_small_050 model.component_overrides.decoder.name=unet model.component_overrides.head.name=db_head model.component_overrides.loss.name=db_loss model/optimizers=adam model.optimizer.lr=0.001 model.optimizer.weight_decay=0.0001 dataloaders.train_dataloader.batch_size=8 dataloaders.val_dataloader.batch_size=8 trainer.max_epochs=15 trainer.accumulate_grad_batches=1 trainer.gradient_clip_val=5.0 trainer.precision=32 seed=42 data=default
   ```
   If the worker keeps dying silently, override the dataloader workers to run in-process (`dataloaders.train_dataloader.num_workers=0 dataloaders.val_dataloader.num_workers=0`) for clearer traces.
2. Review the staged dataset images and adjust `.gitignore` if they should not be checked in.
3. Audit the numerous config/UI/doc diffs for alignment with the refactored workflow, staging or reverting as appropriate.
4. After the training run succeeds, capture validation metrics (especially orientation-aware scores) and confirm WandB summaries reflect the fix.

## Open Questions
- What specifically terminated the validation DataLoader worker?
- Which of the newly added assets/configs are intended for commit vs. local experimentation?
- Do we need additional automated coverage around the Hydra configuration changes?
