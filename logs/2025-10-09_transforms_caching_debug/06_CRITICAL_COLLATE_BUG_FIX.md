# CRITICAL BUG FIX: Collate Function Polygon Shape Mismatch
**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Bug ID**: CRITICAL-2025-001
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical production bug found and fixed**: The collate function (`DBCollateFN`) was crashing DataLoader workers due to polygon shape mismatches, causing silent failures and extremely poor model performance (h-mean: 0.003).

### Impact
- ❌ DataLoader workers crashed silently with multiprocessing errors
- ❌ Model produced clustered predictions with no correlation to ground truth
- ❌ H-mean dropped to 0.003 (should be ~0.4-0.6)
- ❌ Unit tests passed but pipeline failed in production

### Root Cause
Polygon shape inconsistency between transforms output `(N, 2)` and collate function expectations `(1, N, 2)`.

---

## Problem Analysis

### Symptom
```
DataLoader worker (pid 1242778) exited unexpectedly with exit code 1.
Details are lost due to multiprocessing. Rerunning with num_workers=0 may give better error trace.
```

### Root Cause Chain

1. **Our earlier fix** ([ocr/datasets/base.py](ocr/datasets/base.py#L285-L297)) ensured transforms receive numpy arrays
2. **Side effect**: Transform pipeline returns polygons with shape `(N, 2)` (no batch dimension)
3. **Collate function** ([ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py:132](ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py#L132)) assumed shape `(1, N, 2)` (with batch dimension)
4. **Pyclipper crash**: `pco.AddPaths(poly, ...)` received `(N, 2)` but expected list of polygons
5. **Worker crash**: Silent failure in multiprocessing, no useful error message

## Bug Location

### File: ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py

#### Issue 1: Line 132 - pyclipper expects list
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
pco.AddPaths(poly, pyclipper.JT_ROUND, pyclipper.ET_CLOSEDPOLYGON)
# Crashes when poly is (N, 2) instead of (1, N, 2)
```

#### Issue 2: Line 152 - Assumes batch dimension
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
polygon = poly[0].copy()  # Crashes if poly is (N, 2)
```

---

## Fix Implementation

### Change 1: Add shape normalization (Lines 111-114)
```python
for poly in polygons:
    # Ensure polygon is in correct format (N, 2) not (1, N, 2)
    # Some code paths return (N, 2), others return (1, N, 2)
    if poly.ndim == 3 and poly.shape[0] == 1:
        poly = poly[0]  # Remove batch dimension: (1, N, 2) -> (N, 2)

    # ... rest of code
```

### Change 2: Wrap polygon in list for pyclipper (Line 138)
```python
# AFTER (FIXED)
pco.AddPaths([poly], pyclipper.JT_ROUND, pyclipper.ET_CLOSEDPOLYGON)
# Now works with (N, 2) shape
```

### Change 3: Remove incorrect indexing (Line 159)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
polygon = poly[0].copy()  # Assumes (1, N, 2)

# AFTER (FIXED)
polygon = poly.copy()  # Works with (N, 2)
```

## Verification

### Test 1: Polygon with batch dimension (1, 4, 2)
```
✅ SUCCESS - Collate function handled polygon with batch dimension
Prob map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
Thresh map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
```

### Test 2: Polygon without batch dimension (4, 2)
```
✅ SUCCESS - Collate function handled polygon without batch dimension
Prob map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
Thresh map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
```

### Test 3: Multiple polygons (4, 2) each
```
✅ SUCCESS - Collate function handled multiple polygons
Prob map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
Thresh map shape: torch.Size([1, 1, 640, 640])
```

### Test 4: Integration test (800/100 samples, 1 epoch)
```
✅ Training completed without worker crashes
✅ No multiprocessing errors
✅ Validation completed successfully
✅ Test completed successfully
```

## Why Unit Tests Didn't Catch This

1. **Unit tests use mocked data** - Not real end-to-end data flow
2. **Unit tests don't use multiprocessing** - Worker crashes don't occur
3. **Unit tests don't use collate function** - Bug was in collate, not tested directly

### Lesson Learned
**Integration tests are critical** - Unit tests can't catch all bugs, especially multiprocessing issues.

## Impact Analysis

### Before Fix
- ❌ Workers crash with cryptic multiprocessing errors
- ❌ Model performance: h-mean 0.003
- ❌ Predictions clustered abnormally
- ❌ No correlation with ground truth

### After Fix

## Related Issues

### Cascade of Fixes
1. **BUG-2025-002** - PIL Image → numpy array (fixed earlier today)
2. **BUG-2025-003** - Albumentations contract (fixed earlier today)
3. **CRITICAL-2025-001** - Collate polygon shape (THIS FIX)

All three bugs were related:
- First fix ensured numpy arrays throughout
- This changed polygon shapes coming from transforms
- Collate function expected old shapes
- Result: Silent multiprocessing crash

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate
1. ✅ Add shape normalization in collate function
2. ✅ Handle both (N, 2) and (1, N, 2) shapes
3. ✅ Add diagnostic test for polygon shapes

### Long-term
1. ⏳ Add integration tests with real data flow
2. ⏳ Add multiprocessing tests
3. ⏳ Add shape validation at all boundaries
4. ⏳ Document expected data shapes at each stage
5. ⏳ Add runtime shape assertions in debug mode

## Conclusion

This was a **critical production bug** that caused silent failures and extremely poor model performance. The bug was a result of cascading fixes that changed data shapes without updating downstream code.

**Key insight**: Type consistency fixes (BUG-2025-002) had ripple effects throughout the pipeline. When fixing type issues, must verify all downstream consumers still work correctly.

The fix is simple but critical - normalizing polygon shapes in the collate function to handle both formats robustly.
