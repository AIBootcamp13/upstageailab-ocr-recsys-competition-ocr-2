# Session Handover: 2025-10-07_17_00

**Context Window Usage:** 62%
**Current Phase:** Phase 1.1 - Cache PyClipper Polygon Processing
**Reason for Handover:** Context window reached 60% threshold

## Current State

### Completed Work
- ✅ Created detailed implementation plan (`2025-10-07_01_performance_optimization_detailed_plan_initial.md`)
- ✅ Set up TDD test structure in `tests/performance/`
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for polygon caching (`test_polygon_caching.py`)
- ✅ Established logging schema and README in logs directory
- ✅ Analyzed current codebase structure (db_collate_fn.py, base.py, transforms.py)

### In Progress
- Starting implementation of PolygonCache class
- Planning integration with DBCollateFN.make_prob_thresh_map()

### Pending Work
1. Implement PolygonCache class with LRU caching
2. Add cache key generation from polygon geometry
3. Integrate caching into DBCollateFN
4. Add performance metrics and cache hit/miss tracking
5. Run initial performance benchmarks

## Files Modified (This Session)
- `logs/2025-10-07_performance_optimization_refactor_logs/2025-10-07_01_performance_optimization_detailed_plan_initial.md` - Created detailed plan
- `tests/performance/__init__.py` - Created test package
- `tests/performance/test_polygon_caching.py` - Created comprehensive test suite
- `logs/2025-10-07_performance_optimization_refactor_logs/README.md` - Created logging documentation

## Key Variables/Code State
- Test fixtures established for polygon processing
- Cache interface defined (max_size=100, persist_to_disk=False)
- Performance benchmarking structure ready
- Logging schema implemented

## Continuation Prompt

```
Continue the performance optimization work for the OCR training pipeline.

Current context: We are implementing Phase 1.1 (Cache PyClipper Polygon Processing) in the validation pipeline optimization.

Recent progress:
- Created detailed implementation plan with TDD approach
- Set up test structure in tests/performance/
- Analyzed current db_collate_fn.py code (make_prob_thresh_map method does expensive pyclipper operations)
- Established logging schema for progress tracking

Next steps:
1. Implement the PolygonCache class in ocr/datasets/polygon_cache.py
2. Add LRU caching with polygon geometry-based keys
3. Integrate cache into DBCollateFN.make_prob_thresh_map method
4. Run the test suite to validate functionality
5. Measure initial performance improvements

Files to reference:
- `docs/ai_handbook/07_project_management/performance_optimization_plan.md` - Original requirements
- `logs/2025-10-07_performance_optimization_refactor_logs/2025-10-07_01_performance_optimization_detailed_plan_initial.md` - Detailed plan
- `ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py` - Current collate function implementation
- `tests/performance/test_polygon_caching.py` - Test suite to implement against
- `logs/2025-10-07_performance_optimization_refactor_logs/README.md` - Logging schema

Please continue implementing the polygon caching functionality, starting with the PolygonCache class. Focus on TDD - write tests first, then implement the minimal code to pass them.
```

## Important Notes
- All tests in `test_polygon_caching.py` are currently failing (as expected in TDD)
- The cache should use polygon geometry for cache keys (not just polygon coordinates)
- Performance target: 5-8x speedup in validation with <1% accuracy loss
- Context window management: Monitor usage and create handover at 50% warning / 60% stop
