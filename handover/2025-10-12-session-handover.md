# Session Handover – 2025-10-12

## Context
- Active branch: `08_refactor/ocr_pl` (dataset refactor staging branch).
- Working tree includes refactor surfaces and downstream migrations: `ocr/datasets/base.py`, `ocr/datasets/schemas.py`, `ocr/utils/cache_manager.py`, `ocr/utils/image_utils.py`, `ocr/utils/polygon_utils.py`, `ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py`, `scripts/analysis_validation/profile_data_loading.py`, `scripts/analysis_validation/validate_pipeline_contracts.py`, `tests/test_validated_ocr_dataset.py`, and supporting configs.
- Recent tooling: `eval-ui` command failed with exit code 127; UI evaluation not currently running.
- Degenerate polygon incidents logged in `logs/convex_hull_failures.jsonl` during preprocessing (multiple EXIF-aligned samples around y=960).
- Migration blueprint: following "Procedural Refactor Blueprint: OCR Dataset Base" to track stepwise rollout (currently executing Step 3: runtime tooling).

## Completed Work This Session
- Expanded schema layer in `ocr/datasets/schemas.py` to cover cache configs, image metadata, transform IO, and cached artefacts; validators enforce shape/type consistency.
- Refactored `ValidatedOCRDataset` in `ocr/datasets/base.py` to load annotations via schemas, orchestrate cache manager usage, normalize polygons, and surface structured metadata.
- Introduced `ocr/utils/cache_manager.py` with configurable caches (images/maps/tensors), hit/miss logging, and auto-statistics cadence.
- Added `ocr/utils/image_utils.py` for PIL loading, RGB enforcement, numpy conversion, and optional ImageNet pre-normalization.
- Added `ocr/utils/polygon_utils.py` to normalize polygons and filter degenerate shapes while logging removal counts.
- Authored `tests/test_cache_manager.py` to cover cache operations, statistics, and isolation across payload types.
- Added high-level dataset coverage in `tests/test_validated_ocr_dataset.py` (initialization, caching, annotation flow); skeleton integration coverage in `tests/test_ocr_pipeline_integration.py`.
- Migrated `scripts/analysis_validation/profile_data_loading.py` to build `DatasetConfig`, assemble `TransformInput` metadata, and reuse polygon utilities for stage timing.
- Reworked `scripts/analysis_validation/validate_pipeline_contracts.py` to validate the new metadata-centric contract and supply legacy fields only when needed; contract checks (`dataset`, `collate`, `full`) now green.
- Updated `ocr/datasets/db_collate_fn.py` to source filenames, paths, orientations, and canonical sizes from sample metadata with legacy fallbacks, eliminating placeholder fields in downstream consumers.
- Verified migrations by running `pytest tests/test_validated_ocr_dataset.py` (11 passed) and executing the contract validator across components.

## Outstanding / Follow-Up Items
- Re-run broader pytest coverage (`tests/test_cache_manager.py`, `tests/test_ocr_pipeline_integration.py`, runtime smoke tests) after recent tooling migrations.
- Continue Step 3 of the blueprint: migrate remaining runtime scripts, Hydra configs, and callbacks from `OCRDataset` to `ValidatedOCRDataset` (focus on preprocessing CLI, benchmarking utilities, and Lightning callbacks).
- Mirror metadata-first handling in other collate utilities (e.g., `craft_collate_fn`) and ensure batching metadata surfaces consistently.
- Decide migration path for legacy helpers duplicated inside `ocr/datasets/base.py` (e.g., static `safe_get_image_size`) to avoid divergence with new utilities.
- Investigate degenerate polygon logs—confirm `filter_degenerate_polygons` thresholds align with production tolerances and whether preprocessing steps should repair these samples instead of dropping them.
- Ensure new schema constraints remain compatible with Hydra configs under `configs/`; update dataclass instantiations or Hydra conversions if necessary.
- Verify map loading with real `.npz` assets and adjust `validate_map_shapes` thresholds to prevent false negatives.

## Risks / Considerations
- CacheManager currently logs statistics globally; high-frequency access without `log_statistics_every_n` set could hide cache pressure—consider wiring metric hooks or watchdog sampling.
- Dataset tests use patched image loader paths (`ocr.utils.image_loading.load_image_optimized`) that may diverge from new `image_utils` entry points; integration stubs may need rework.
- Orientation handling assumes polygons reference canonical frame; unresolved canonical flagging could reintroduce convex hull failures.
- Tensor cache equality comparisons rely on default Pydantic model equality; confirm this remains stable across torch tensor revisions.

## Test & Verification Status
- Previously: `pytest tests/test_cache_manager.py` (20 passed) before latest schema/test edits.
- Latest: `pytest tests/test_validated_ocr_dataset.py` (11 passed) and contract validation script (`scripts/analysis_validation/validate_pipeline_contracts.py` with `--component dataset|collate|full`).
- Pending: `pytest tests/test_cache_manager.py` (re-run), `pytest tests/test_ocr_pipeline_integration.py`, and broader runtime/integration smoke tests.
- No new UI/e2e validation performed; `eval-ui` command failure indicates UI harness unavailable.

## Rolling Context Updates (2025-10-12)
- Blueprint Step 3 in progress: profiling/contract scripts and DB collate now on `ValidatedOCRDataset`; remaining runtime consumers queued for migration.
- Consolidated inventory of `OCRDataset` usage (configs, runtime scripts, callbacks, and legacy tests) to guide ongoing rollout.

## Continuation Prompts
1. "Run `pytest tests/test_cache_manager.py tests/test_ocr_pipeline_integration.py` to validate cache behaviour and pipeline integration after the latest collate/tooling refactors."
2. "Finish Step 3 migrations by updating remaining runtime scripts, Hydra configs, and callbacks to instantiate `ValidatedOCRDataset` via `DatasetConfig`."
3. "Port metadata-first logic to `craft_collate_fn` (and any other collates) so all batching utilities rely on the new contract."
4. "Review `logs/convex_hull_failures.jsonl` and tune `filter_degenerate_polygons` thresholds or preprocessing fixes to reduce degeneracy drops."
5. "Validate map loading against real `.npz` assets and adjust `validate_map_shapes` tolerances if legitimate samples are rejected."
