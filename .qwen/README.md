# Project Agent Configuration

This project uses a structured approach for organizing agent instructions and configurations.

## Directory Structure

- `.qwen/` - Main entry point and general project instructions (QWEN.md)
- `.AGENTS/` - Agent-specific instructions organized by purpose:
  - `general-prompting/` - General prompting guidelines and templates
  - `code-review/` - Code review agent instructions and checklists
  - `planning/` - Planning and task management agent instructions
  - `analysis/` - Data analysis and research agent instructions
  - `custom-agents/` - Custom agent implementations and specifications

## Purpose

This structure allows for:
1. A central entry point (QWEN.md) for general project context
2. Specialized agent instructions based on task requirements
3. Clear organization and maintainability of agent-specific instructions
