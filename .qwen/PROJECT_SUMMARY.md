# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Generate comprehensive pytest test suites for the CacheManager class and other OCR dataset components, including all public methods, cache hit/miss scenarios, statistics logging, edge cases, and integration tests.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: PyTorch Lightning, Hydra, Pydantic v2 for validation, pytest for testing
- **Architecture**: Modular OCR system with plug-and-play components (encoders, decoders, heads, losses)
- **Key Components**: CacheManager handles caching of images, tensors, and maps with statistics tracking
- **Testing Framework**: UV for package management, Ruff for formatting and linting, pytest with comprehensive test suites
- **Build Commands**: `uv run` prefix for Python commands
- **Project Structure**: CacheManager in `ocr/utils/cache_manager.py`, schemas in `ocr/datasets/schemas.py`
- **Testing Approach**: Comprehensive pytest suites with fixtures for common test data and proper isolation between tests

## Recent Actions
- **[DONE]** Comprehensive CacheManager test suite created with 20 passing tests covering all functionality
- **[DONE]** ValidatedOCRDataset tests updated with proper mocking to avoid file I/O issues
- **[DONE]** Integration tests fixed to properly mock image loading functionality
- **[DONE]** Created ValidatedOCRDataset class implementation based on blueprint documentation
- **[DONE]** Fixed import and scoping issues in the dataset implementation
- **[DONE]** All CacheManager tests passing (20/20) with comprehensive coverage
- **[DONE]** Mocked image loading using `patch.object(ValidatedOCRDataset, '_load_image_data')` approach
- **[DONE]** Added proper type hints and validation for all test parameters

## Current Plan
- **[DONE]** Complete CacheManager test suite with all public methods covered
- **[DONE]** Fix ValidatedOCRDataset tests with proper mocking
- **[DONE]** Update integration tests to work with mocking
- **[DONE]** Implement ValidatedOCRDataset class based on blueprint
- **[DONE]** Verify all existing tests pass after changes
- **[DONE]** Document comprehensive test coverage and functionality

The testing work is complete with the CacheManager test suite being fully comprehensive and passing. The other test suites have been updated to work with proper mocking strategies.
