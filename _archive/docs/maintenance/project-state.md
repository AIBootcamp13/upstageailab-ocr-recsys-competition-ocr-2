# Project State - DBNet OCR Competition

## Current Status: MODULAR ARCHITECTURE + COMPONENT REGISTRY
*Last updated: 2025-09-27*

### 2025-09-26 Update â€“ Mixed Precision Compatibility
- Re-enabled `persistent_workers` with tuned worker counts (train 8 / val & test 4 / predict 2) and increased `prefetch_factor` for better GPU saturation on RTX 3090-class hardware.
- Default `data.batch_size` raised to 12 and Lightning trainer now runs with `precision=16-mixed`, `benchmark=true`, and gradient clipping (`gradient_clip_val=5.0`).
- `DBHead` now returns a `binary_logits` tensor alongside probability maps; `DBLoss` consumes logits via `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` to avoid AMP warnings.
- `DBPostProcessor` converts prediction maps to `float32` before OpenCV routines to maintain compatibility under mixed precision.
- Added regression tests ensuring the new head outputs and fast-dev smoke test confirm the BCE autocast warning is resolved.

## Architecture Refactoring Progress âœ…

### Abstract Base Classes Implementation

### Component Registry System
- **ComponentRegistry**: Centralized registry for all OCR architecture components
- **Plug-and-play Architecture**: Register and discover encoders, decoders, heads, losses, and metrics
- **Architecture Presets**: Pre-configured component combinations (e.g., 'dbnet')
- **Factory Functions**: Automated component instantiation with configuration validation

### DBNet Component Migration
- **TimmBackbone**: Migrated to inherit from `BaseEncoder` with proper type hints
- **UNetDecoder**: Migrated to inherit from `BaseDecoder` with abstract method implementation
- **DBHead**: Migrated to inherit from `BaseHead` with standardized prediction interface
- **DBLoss**: Migrated to inherit from `BaseLoss` with unified loss computation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing configuration and training workflows

### Registry Integration
- **DBNet Architecture**: Registered complete DBNet architecture preset
- **Component Discovery**: All components discoverable through registry API
- **Architecture Creation**: One-line creation of complete model architectures

### Architecture Expansion Progress ðŸš€
- **CRAFT Architecture**: Added full encoder/decoder/head/loss stack with registry registration and Hydra presets (`preset/models/craft.yaml`)
- **DBNet++ Variant**: Introduced bi-directional decoder, upgraded presets (`preset/models/dbnetpp.yaml`), and registry registration (`dbnetpp`)
- **Data Pipeline Support**: New `CraftCollateFN` generates region/affinity maps compatible with CRAFT training
- **Configuration Flexibility**: `OCRModel` now supports `architecture_name` + `component_overrides` for registry-driven instantiation
- **Unit Tests**: Added coverage for new components (`tests/test_craft_components.py`, `tests/test_dbnetpp_components.py`, registry path in `tests/test_architecture.py`)
- **Decoder Library** *(2025-09-27)*: Added shared `fpn_decoder` and `pan_decoder` options registered in the component registry with UI metadata updates for receipt-focused experimentation.
- **Decoder Benchmarking Toolkit** *(2025-09-27)*: Introduced `scripts/decoder_benchmark.py` with Hydra configuration (`configs/benchmark/decoder.yaml`) to sweep decoder overrides and produce CSV summaries for FPN, PAN, and UNet baselines.

## Process Management Improvements âœ…

### Orphaned Process Prevention
- **Signal Handling**: Added SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers to `runners/train.py` for graceful shutdown
- **Process Groups**: Implemented process group management (`os.setpgrp()`, `os.setsid()`) to ensure complete cleanup
- **DataLoader Safety**: Disabled `persistent_workers` in all dataloaders to prevent orphaned worker processes
- **UI Process Control**: Enhanced command execution with process group termination capabilities

### Process Monitoring Utilities
- **Process Monitor Script**: Created `scripts/process_monitor.py` for detecting and cleaning up orphaned processes
- **Comprehensive Detection**: Monitors both training processes and their DataLoader worker processes
- **Safe Termination**: Supports graceful (SIGTERM) and forceful (SIGKILL) process termination
- **Dry-run Mode**: Preview what would be terminated without actually doing it

### UI Enhancements
- **Resource Monitor UI**: New comprehensive monitoring interface for system resources, training processes, and GPU utilization
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CPU, memory, GPU usage with progress bars and metrics
- **Process Management**: Interactive process termination with confirmation dialogs
